# Salted Hoya

"Salted Hoya" is an individual developer.

Hoya no shiokara is a Japanese delicacy made from sea pineapple (hoya), a unique marine creature. The edible parts are heavily salted and fermented, often with the hoya's own internal organs. This preservation method, "shiokara," results in an intensely salty, umami-rich flavor with a pungent aroma and chewy texture. It's considered a "chinmi" (rare taste) in Japan, often enjoyed in small amounts as an accompaniment to sake, particularly in coastal regions like Tohoku where hoya is a local specialty. It's an acquired taste that offers a concentrated burst of oceanic and fermented flavors.
