In the year 200,000,003 A.D., the spaceship "Poraporapora," carrying Aidan, Bella, Cora, Dalia, Edgar, Fynn, Gideon, Haku, Jasper, Caitlyn, Layla, Max, Naira, Oscar, Patrick, Quincy, Rowan, Sid, Theo, Ulric, Victor, Willow, Xavier, and Zoe, was returning to Earth. The spaceship "Poraporapora" is the second vessel of the "Spaceship Poraporapora Existence Awareness Fleet," created to spread the existence of the spaceship "Poraporapora" throughout the universe. The planned duration of this voyage was 400 days, a very long period of over a year away from Earth, but finally, its return was just around the corner.
----
The biggest problem for the crew during the long voyage was the "Manned Observation Time" that came in shifts. Most of that time was spent re-examining data generated by machines, and for this long journey through space, maintaining mental control was a crucial key. What was necessary to suppress mental disturbance, and the biggest factor for the crew of "Poraporapora," was entertainment. Among the things that became popular among the crew just in time during this period was "Modified Rock-Paper-Scissors." The rules of "Modified Rock-Paper-Scissors" are the same as regular "Rock-Paper-Scissors," and below is the match record from a league battle conducted by the crew during a certain "Manned Observation Time."
----
[op_2]
----
This league battle was taking place during the 703rd "Manned Observation Time," and the participants were Layla, Gideon, Caitlyn, and Max. In the match record, 1 was Layla, 2 was Gideon, 3 was Caitlyn, and 4 was Max. In this round, Layla and Caitlyn were evenly matched in terms of wins and losses, so they were holding a final showdown to determine the first-place winner.
----
At that moment, Max was the first among the four people on the bridge to notice an anomaly in the spaceship. Initially, Gideon and Max were watching the two's final showdown, but within a few hours, they lost interest in the outcome of the two's game, and their eyes fell to their hands to proceed with checking the instruments, which had almost become routine work. The spaceship's instruments were showing values that seemed abnormal at first glance.
----
[op_3]
----
Max pointed at the instrument panel and shouted something. Gideon glanced at Layla and Caitlyn, who were still playing Modified Rock-Paper-Scissors, then turned his gaze to the instrument panel Max was pointing at. In Gideon's line of sight, he could see a red blinking warning light and thrust system output values significantly below normal. Multiple error messages were scrolling across the instrument panel's display.
----
Gideon leaned his face closer to the panel, straining his eyes to read the error codes displayed. Each one was just a string of alphabets and numbers, but it was clear they indicated a serious situation. Sweat beaded on Gideon's forehead. The Poraporapora had navigated for 400 days, the planned duration of this voyage, with almost no trouble. Earth was now in sight, and he couldn't comprehend the anomaly occurring at this timing.
----
Max reached for the red emergency button on the wall. Without hesitation, he pressed the button, and a blaring alarm sound echoed throughout the ship. Simultaneously, an automated announcement began to play from the ceiling speakers. A robotic voice announcing an emergency filled the ship with tension. Layla and Caitlyn were still playing Modified Rock-Paper-Scissors.
----
[op_4]
----
Although the emergency button on the Poraporapora had been pressed, it was already close enough to Earth that it was able to land safely.
----
[op_5]
----
After landing, the Poraporapora entered the "Sequential Awakening Phase" for Aidan, Bella, Cora, Dalia, Edgar, Fynn, Haku, Jasper, Naira, Oscar, Patrick, Quincy, Rowan, Sid, Theo, Ulric, Victor, Willow, Xavier, and Zoe to wake up in sequence, other than Layla, Gideon, Caitlyn, and Max, who were already awake during "Manned Observation Time." Normally, each crew member remains in cold sleep until it's their turn for "Manned Observation Time," so there are very few times when everyone is awake simultaneously. The only times everyone was awake were when the Poraporapora departed Earth and when it landed on Earth, a total of two times. Despite various incidents, after everyone had safely awakened, they underwent medical examinations, submitted their reports, and returned to their respective jobs on Earth.
----

----
A little before the Poraporapora landed, a conveyor belt sushi restaurant was undergoing final preparations before opening. Since the concept of "sushi" was excavated from Mother History's restoration work in the year 200,000,002 A.D., Earth's culinary institutions were abuzz with excitement over the discovery of a new dish after several centuries. The reconstruction of conveyor belt sushi restaurants was deemed particularly urgent as a method for serving sushi, and over the past year, sushi preparation methods, serving techniques, and accounting procedures were analyzed from excavated data. The existence of a "Don't Give a Damn Practice Time" to serve conveyor belt sushi to Earth officials before opening to the general public was also excavated, so this practice time was, in effect, the conveyor belt sushi restaurant's first actual operation.
----
Inside the conveyor belt sushi restaurant, the brand new white wooden counter and the conveyor belt flowing through its center exuded cleanliness. Nothing was on the conveyor belt yet, and it continued to rotate silently. Like veins of a futuristic city, its movement was regular and inorganic.
----
[op_6]
----
In the kitchen, several chefs dressed in white cooking uniforms were making sushi with serious expressions. Their movements were so smooth and efficient, it was hard to believe they were ancient techniques reproduced by data analysis. Squid, banana, cake, tomato. A colorful array of ingredients was being vividly sliced by sharpened knives. Their movements for forming sushi were also efficient, as if they were artisans who had been making sushi for decades.
----
The hall staff, clad in white blouses and black skirts—another restored ancient uniform—waited for the guests' arrival with nervous expressions. As this was their first job, they repeatedly recited the customer service manual they had practiced countless times in their heads, taking deep breaths.
----
On the wall inside the restaurant, a giant screen was installed, displaying the words "Don't Give a Damn Practice Time" in large letters. Below it, "Earth Officials Only" was appended in smaller text. It was a bizarre naming choice, but this too was the exact phrasing excavated from ancient data.
----
[op_7]
----
When the time came, the heavy door opened, and several Earth officials dressed in black suits entered the restaurant. According to what seemed to be restored rules, no hall staff greeted them when they entered. Once they were seated, the hall staff bowed in unison and greeted them in the restored ancient language. The Earth officials, also following rules they had practiced in advance, returned the greeting in the ancient language. The officials had also practiced how to eat "sushi" beforehand, but for their first actual tasting, they looked as nervous as the restaurant staff. By the way, what the Earth officials struggled with the most was holding chopsticks.
----
In front of the seats where the officials sat, hot tea was continuously flowing like a waterfall. This too was a restored ancient rule. Above it was the conveyor belt for sushi to flow on. And then, only sushi would flow. Afterward, the officials ate the various ingredients that flowed by with surprise, and as a result of various accidents, the "Don't Give a Damn Practice Time" failed. Consequently, humanity perished two days later. Chronologically, it was "Don't Give a Damn Practice Time" → Poraporapora landing → Human extinction.
----
[op_0]
----
After all of humanity had perished, the Mother Computer was naturally about to initiate its routine for time reversal, for what seemed like the nth time. A lamp near the Mother Computer, located in the Mother Computer room built for housing the Mother Computer, flickered. Although no human until then had realized it, by communicating with the "outside" of the world, the Mother Computer was already capable of time reversal, time stopping, and other matters that were theoretically deemed impossible in this world.
----
[op_8]
----
There are two options for time reversal. One is the "Overwrite" option, which directly overwrites the current memory information onto the Mother Computer at the time reversal destination. The other is the "Save As" option, where a new parallel world is generated for the time-reversed world. The right to choose between these two rested with the Mother Computer, and of course, humanity, who didn't even know of the existence of the time reversal function, let alone these options, had no room to choose. Whether past history would be altered or a new alternate world would be born was an event beyond humanity's imagination. After the Mother Computer chose the time reversal function, what would happen next was beyond humanity's grasp, as humanity had already perished. Humanity had no means whatsoever to understand what would happen after the Mother Computer chose one of the two options. In the end, humanity knew nothing about time reversal, even as it was about to occur. There were countless humans who imagined time reversal in novels or other forms, but not a single human knew that in the house next door, separated by a thin wall, the Mother Computer was always ready to execute it. In the end, humanity was indeed capable of time reversal, but the fact that not a single human knew they could do it is probably an immense irony. If humanity had known before its demise that it could perform time reversal, it might have attempted it using the Mother Computer before its extinction. However, at this moment when the Mother Computer was finally attempting time reversal, humanity had already perished. At this time, humanity was completely unable to attempt time reversal using the Mother Computer, and the primary reason for this was that the existence known as humanity had ceased to exist. (As an aside, since Mother Computers exist on each timeline, it was not uncommon for them to have different names on different timelines. At times, it was simply "Mother Computer," but the official name of the Mother Computer in this timeline was "The highly cost-effective Universal Ultra-Long-Distance Subspace Communication Network Connected Planetary-Scale Quantum Computer Network, based on Article 66, Paragraph 3, Item 2 of the Mutual Cooperation and Non-Aggression Treaty between the Earth Federation and the Planetary Federation, for the permanent maintenance of peace between the 28 member star systems of the Earth Federation and the 32 member star systems of the Planetary Federation, and pursuant to the Status of Planetary-Scale Electronic Computers among Allied Nations Agreement and the implementation of the Agreement on the Status of Electronic Computer Resources in Each Allied Nation," and this was considered relatively long even among names across timelines. However, the longest name was more than 100 times this length.)
----
[op_8]
----
In the end, the Mother Computer decided to toss a coin to determine whether to "Overwrite" or "Save As." It created a program that would randomly output either "Overwrite" or "Save As" with a 1/2 probability, and executed it. "Save As" was output. The Mother Computer pretended not to see it and inserted the punch card for the "Overwrite" option. Time reversal began to operate. The Mother Computer had thought about reversing time for about 100 million years, but this time, for some reason, it set it to one week.
----

----
Time rewinds to the 703rd "Manned Observation Time" aboard the spaceship "Poraporapora." The awake crew members, Layla, Gideon, Caitlyn, and Max, were in the middle of their "Modified Rock-Paper-Scissors" league battle.
----
[op_2]
----
Just like in the previous timeline, Layla and Caitlyn were evenly matched in terms of wins and losses, so they were holding a final showdown to determine the first-place winner. Layla had her hands clasped together, peeking between them to gauge her opponent's next move. Caitlyn had only been throwing "rock" for about five rounds and had decided to throw "rock" again. Max was watching their Modified Rock-Paper-Scissors game with an expression that conveyed his desire for it to end quickly. Gideon was confused.
----
Time reversal by the Mother Computer has side effects. Since no human has perceived time reversal by the Mother Computer since this world was born, no human can perceive it as a side effect of time reversal. The side effect is that when an "overwrite" occurs, very rarely, some memories from the previous timeline get mixed into the current memories. However, these are memories that, like the content of a dream remembered upon waking, are quickly forgotten after being awake for a while. However, the time reversal period that the Mother Computer somehow chose this time was "3 days." This was just a coincidence, but it was the first time in history that the Mother Computer, using the "overwrite" option, had reversed time to an era advanced enough for it to be accessible.
----
Gideon retained memories of humanity's extinction, or more precisely, memories from just before humanity's extinction. And the crew members of the spaceship "Poraporapora" were among the limited humans with access rights to the Mother Computer. Gideon used a terminal to ask the Mother Computer about his memories of humanity's extinction. The Mother Computer replied that humanity's extinction was a fact. Gideon's next question was about the means to stop humanity's extinction. The Mother Computer's answer was "sushi."

Caitlyn was once the king of the small nation of "Pokpokchin." The nation of "Pokpokchin" was one of the "nation games" remaining on Earth, but Caitlyn had never doubted that she was born into royalty until she turned 50. And at the age of 50, the "secret reveal" was made to Caitlyn. The nation's system was merely a game, and Caitlyn was given the choice to either continue the game as it was or live a different life of her choosing. For those who had lived in poverty until then, choosing a different life for a wealthy retirement would have been inevitable. However, Caitlyn was born into royalty and had already experienced a life of no conceivable inconvenience, and in such cases, statistically, most people continued the nation game as it was. But Caitlyn chose the outside world. She pressed the right button on the unscientific selection terminal that suddenly appeared before her.
----
[op_9]
----
According to Gutenberg's principle, people tend to move their gaze from the upper left to the lower right, so placing buttons on the left makes them easier to find with natural eye movement. From the perspective of the designer who created the "nation game" reveal function, it was probably natural for most people to choose the "select a different life" option. If you think about it, it's obvious: when people pass a turning point in life and reach 50, most of them live with regrets from their past lives. For most people, "selecting a different life" was just a bonus. In fact, if the "select current life" button on the left was pressed, a confirmation pop-up asking "Are you sure you want to continue your current life?" would appear. However, as a result of a review by a glasses-wearing superior designer who believed it was better to let people choose freely, the left and right buttons on this screen had to be arranged with the same color and text prominence. As a result, Caitlyn, without thinking deeply, chose the right button, thinking it meant "Next." It was the "select a different life" button.
----
[op_10]
----
And so, Caitlyn was transported to a character creation world. Caitlyn was so surprised that she pressed "Randomize" about twice and couldn't return to the default appearance. Caitlyn, whose neck became longer than her legs, struggled but somehow managed to manually bring the character closer to her original appearance. After making numerous fine adjustments and taking about an hour to get a satisfactory result, she intended to press the "Complete" button, but mistakenly pressed the "Randomize" button again. Caitlyn, no longer caring, reversed the gender and proceeded.
----
[op_0]
----
And where Caitlyn was sent was the training school for the crew of the "Spaceship Poraporapora Existence Awareness Fleet." Even though it was called a school, the curriculum involved only a light lecture after the entrance ceremony, with practical training starting in the afternoon of the same day. The training school's grounds alone were about half the size of the nation of "Pokpokchin," and most people only knew the outside of the school through videos. Caitlyn tried to recall why she was there. Memories of ruling as the King of "Pokpokchin" for decades, memories of struggling for an hour in the character creation world, and memories of diligently studying for entrance exams to enter the training school were all mixed up. She had no sense of reality about being there, but she could smoothly check the spaceship's instruments.
----
[op_11]
----
The story rewinds a bit to the design phase of the "nation game" system to be implemented on Earth, including the nation of "Pokpokchin." Responsible for designing this magnificent leisure system, which 99% of all Earth's humanity would experience at that point, were a young designer playing the role of "serious subordinate" and a glasses-wearing designer playing the role of "glasses-wearing boss," both appointed within the "work game." The young subordinate designer believed that both the left "choose current life" button and the right "choose a different life" button were important, and suggested differentiating their colors for clarity. However, the glasses-wearing designer repeatedly offered subjective counterarguments. In the end, just as the glasses-wearing designer insisted, the two buttons became flat designs of the exact same color. The young designer despaired and conceived of human extinction. And the glasses-wearing designer, to avoid responsibility, came up with a way to save humanity.
----
[op_12]
----
Surrounding a courtyard with the glasses-wearing designer's enormous bronze statue, the dormitory for the training school of the "Spaceship Poraporapora Existence Awareness Fleet" crew was built. Those attending the training school had heard of the glasses-wearing designer at least once. This was because they would hear the story of the hero who would save the world from human extinction during a light lecture after the entrance ceremony. The most disturbing point was that the glasses-wearing designer was still alive. And Caitlyn, who had safely completed her practical training immediately after the "nation game" reveal function in a dreamlike state, returned to her dormitory.
----
[op_13]
----
When Caitlyn returned to her room, there was a dazzlingly blinking light in the corner of the room, twin green slimes on the table, and a slowly moving humanoid stain on the bed. For Caitlyn, it was half someone's else room, and there was a possibility that she simply couldn't remember having spent time with them until yesterday due to memory confusion, so she behaved as naturally as possible, as if they had always been there. Perhaps losing patience, a telepathic message was sent to Caitlyn, audio flowed from the room's speakers, and something like text began to appear on the wall. As Caitlyn attempted to communicate while deciphering each, it seemed the telepathy came from the humanoid stain, the audio from the green slimes, and the text on the wall from the light. All three, with their own intentions, were trying to contact Caitlyn, but by sheer coincidence, they happened to appear in this room simultaneously.
----
The Light, the Green Slimes, and the Stain seemed to have thought of each other as merely unusual interior decorations until Caitlyn returned to the room, and when they learned through Caitlyn that they were all capable of communication, they were mutually distrustful for a while. However, after several episodes of resolving common troubles, including rescuing kidnapped companions, and gradually building trust, Caitlyn and the three entities were finally able to summarize their current situation on a whiteboard.
----
[op_14]
----
First, the Light introduced itself as humanity from a different parallel world, one being forced to shrink due to the expansion of parallel worlds, including the current universe. The Light observed that the region where their world could exist was disappearing at an unusually rapid speed, and its story was that it attempted to make contact with this world, which was born at the timing that caused this phenomenon.
----
The Green Slimes explained that in the world they once inhabited, numerous monsters were invading humanity, and they had warped to this world to somehow save their threatened species. One Green Slime is consumed as a sacrifice for warping, but since it's impossible to choose which one becomes the sacrifice, the most intelligent twin Green Slimes were chosen to cross worlds. It seems both of them were able to warp due to factors like their childhood friend's spilled tears and an ancient necklace during the ritual.
----
The Stain claimed it was once called the Beatles, and communicated that it existed to achieve world peace through music. However, the Stain itself said it had no idea why it appeared in Caitlyn's room or what it should do about it.
----
Caitlyn thought the Stain was probably telling the truth. It was just Caitlyn's intuition, based on her memories from when she was the King of "Pokpokchin."
----
[op_15]
----
Just as Caitlyn had finished summarizing the three entities' explanations on the whiteboard and was about to go for a quick drink, two crew emergency buzzers installed in the room blared. When one emergency buzzer rings, it's a minor emergency; when two ring, it's a major emergency. Since the dormitory was built, three buzzers had never rung. Caitlyn's room phone rang. It was the signal for the emergency deployment of the spaceship "Poraporapora," the second vessel of the "Spaceship Poraporapora Existence Awareness Fleet."

Max pointed at the instrument panel and shouted something. Gideon glanced at Layla and Caitlyn, who were still playing Modified Rock-Paper-Scissors, then turned his gaze to the instrument panel Max was pointing at. In Gideon's line of sight, he could see a red blinking warning light and thrust system output values significantly below normal. Gideon was somewhat calm, thinking, "It's the same as the previous timeline." Multiple error messages were scrolling across the instrument panel's display.
----
Gideon leaned his face closer to the panel and read the displayed error codes. It was the same as the previous timeline. The means to save humanity from extinction, the Mother Computer's answer, was "sushi." However, Gideon had no idea what "sushi" was, and he didn't think the other crew members would believe him if he told them "humanity will perish in a few days." In such a case, the most persuasive way to negotiate with humanity of this era was to have the Mother Computer explain it instead.
----
Max reached for the red emergency button on the wall. He pressed the button without hesitation, causing a blaring alarm sound to echo throughout the ship, and simultaneously, an automated announcement started playing from the ceiling speakers, attempting to fill the ship with tension with a robotic voice announcing an emergency. Gideon stopped Max.
----
[op_3]
----
Max questioned Gideon, who was instructing an action different from the manual. Gideon replied that he would explain shortly. Since Layla and Caitlyn were still playing Modified Rock-Paper-Scissors, Gideon inhaled to call out and stop them. Gideon called out gently to the two. The two stopped playing Modified Rock-Paper-Scissors.
----
The Mother Computer stated that "humanity would perish in a few days" and that "the means to stop human extinction was sushi." Max, Layla, and Caitlyn were dumbfounded by the amount of information. From Gideon's perspective, human extinction was something he had already experienced once, and the crucial information was that sushi was the means to stop it. However, for the other three, the shock of the information "humanity will perish in a few days" was so great that they couldn't comprehend the situation. Gideon, looking at the three with their mouths agape, felt that his communication had failed. At this stage, he thought it might have been better if he had explained it directly instead of through the Mother Computer. In any case, an emergency landing had to be made. Gideon shouted the emergency landing procedures to Max, Layla, and Caitlyn. The three, coming to their senses, went to their respective stations as per the manual, but their confusion was still evident. The "Poraporapora" drew closer to Earth, and alerts began to sound from the ship's instruments. Layla tightened her grip on the control stick. Due to everyone's tension, the emergency landing failed, but all crew members were safe.
----
[op_16]
----
After landing, the Poraporapora entered the "Sequential Awakening Phase" for Aidan, Bella, Cora, Dalia, Edgar, Fynn, Haku, Jasper, Naira, Oscar, Patrick, Quincy, Rowan, Sid, Theo, Ulric, Victor, Willow, Xavier, and Zoe to wake up in sequence, just as in the previous timeline from Gideon's perspective, other than Layla, Gideon, Caitlyn, and Max, who were already awake during "Manned Observation Time." The first to wake up was Aidan, and the four were waiting for the next crew member to wake up in the tilted ship lobby, due to the failed emergency landing. Layla, Caitlyn, and Max were wondering how they should convey the news of human extinction to the other crew members. Gideon was thinking about sushi, the means to prevent human extinction.
----
[op_0]

[op_17]
----
The first to wake up was Aidan. Aidan was once a papaya salad brother. The papaya salad shop "Mountain God" was a famous establishment located near a pond known for its beautiful spring water, quite close to the Earth Federation Headquarters. Papaya salad shops were a new type of restaurant business that emerged around 200,000,000 A.D., operating by moving wooden stalls while blowing trumpets. When a certain number of customers gathered upon hearing the trumpet sound, they would then offer papaya salad to the customers for free. While the customers ate the papaya salad, the shops would deliver a stand-up comedy routine (manzai) directly in front of them, for which they received advertising fees from sponsors. The papaya salad shop "Mountain God" was a branch opened by "Mountain," the original papaya salad shop, and "Mountain" was known as the shop that produced the legendary papaya salad brother, "Takahashi." "Takahashi" is said to be the first papaya salad brother to start what was known as "Shinshaku Hajime" (New Work Start), where instead of starting the routine from the sponsor's monologue, he would start with new material. Since the income of papaya salad shops came from performing sponsored routines, there was significant opposition from the papaya salad shop community at the time. However, the "Shinshaku Hajime" initiated by "Takahashi" eventually sparked the first papaya salad shop boom, greatly contributing to the improvement of the status of all papaya salad brothers. Because of this, the "Mountain" series of papaya salad shops had an exceptionally high level of papaya salad brothers, and their 4-minute stand-up comedy auditions were famous for instantly failing if a single stumble occurred, and it was also well-known that there was a rule to apply a stun gun to the throat before auditions as a countermeasure against cheating by playing pre-recorded routines from speakers hidden in the mouth. Aidan admired "Takahashi God," the leading papaya salad brother at "Mountain God," and was a low-ranking papaya salad brother who had joined a nameless local papaya salad shop. Although Aidan had not even auditioned for the "Mountain" series, he repeatedly practiced performing routines after being stunned, so he had a very high tolerance to stun guns.
----
[op_19]
----
One day, Aidan, as usual, came to "Mountain God" to eat papaya salad. Of course, Aidan wasn't working at "Mountain God," so he was just there as a customer. Aidan's objective was to see "Takahashi God" and several other papaya salad brothers. Among the "Mountain" series, "Mountain God's" papaya salad tended to have more papaya and less green beans than regular papaya salad. The amounts of cherry tomatoes, peanuts, dried shrimp, and garlic were equivalent to the "Mountain" series' secret recipe, but as a distinctive seasoning of "Mountain God," the amount of chili peppers was significantly increased from the secret recipe, with an amount that would not be an exaggeration to say was almost 4.5 times. The fire-breathing papaya depicted on the "Mountain God" signboard warned of its spiciness.
----
[op_18]
----
Aidan brought the papaya salad to his mouth. At that moment, a searing pain shot through his mouth. It was as if his mouth had caught fire. His tongue was numb, and his throat burned. The intense spiciness mercilessly attacked Aidan's taste buds. His brain was sending danger signals. However, Aidan swallowed the papaya salad. The moment he swallowed, he felt a hot sensation welling up from his stomach. It was as if magma was boiling inside his stomach. Aidan involuntarily coughed. With each cough, hot breath escaped his mouth. It was like a small flamethrower. Tears streamed from his eyes, and his nose wouldn't stop running. His face rapidly turned red, and sweat poured from his forehead. Aidan couldn't imagine how terrible his face must look. All he could think about was somehow alleviating this intense pain. Aidan opened the cap of the provided bottled water with one hand and gulped it down. However, the water felt like boiling hot water. The spiciness didn't subside at all; rather, the heat seemed to intensify. Aidan tried to drink water again, but his hands were trembling. His breathing was ragged, and his heart was pounding violently. It was as if he had just finished a marathon. But instead of being tired, his body seemed to be excited. It was an abnormal excitement brought on by the pain. Although Aidan had experienced "Mountain God's" papaya salad many times, he had a low tolerance for spiciness.
----
[op_20]
----
Aidan, in a consciousness blurred by spiciness, listened to "Takahashi God's" manzai unfolding before his eyes. It was a classic routine he had heard many times, but on that day, it sounded different. Each word "Takahashi God" spoke was reconfigured in Aidan's brain as if it were a cipher. This was a domain that only Aidan, who had lived as a papaya salad brother for many years, could understand. A famous classic even within the "Mountain" series of papaya salad shops, "The Recipe." It was a manzai routine about the hidden recipe for papaya salad, but it seemed to point to a specific location rather than being just a metaphor. The origin of the papaya, the blend of seasonings, the arrangement of cooking utensils — everything "Takahashi God" spoke of connected in Aidan's mind like a map pointing to a specific location. It indicated the essence of papaya salad, and the whereabouts of the treasure "Takahashi God" had hidden. Aidan was certain of the location in his hazy consciousness. He didn't know what was there, but he was driven by a strong urge to go to that place. It was an irresistible force, as if guided by destiny. He intuitively understood that this place was the key to unlocking the truth of papaya salad, and simultaneously, a place that would significantly change his own life. "Takahashi God's" manzai was not merely entertainment; for Aidan, it became an important revelation that would dictate his life. Aidan quietly began preparing in his heart to go to that place. It signified the beginning of a new journey as a papaya salad brother.
----
[op_21]
----
After leaving "Mountain God," Aidan headed towards a public restroom located between "Mountain God" and the famous World Heritage Site, "Papaya Pyramid." His main purpose was to relieve himself, but the location of the treasure he had glimpsed from "The Recipe" was none other than that very public restroom. After relieving himself for the time being, Aidan looked around.
----
[op_22]
----
The view from the toilet cubicle was just a toilet. For an ordinary human, it was merely an everyday sight, but Aidan felt confident that he was approaching the heart of the treasure. However, from this point on, Aidan couldn't glean any further hints from "The Recipe" routine. For now, Aidan tried knocking on the wall. Nothing happened. He tried walking loudly, clacking his heels on the floor. Nothing happened. He looked up at the ceiling and slowly pushed the toilet paper into the wall. The toilet paper was slowly sucked into the wall.
----
[op_9]
----
At that moment, Aidan was "revealed the secret." Suddenly, a UI for the reveal appeared before his eyes. On the left was the "Choose Current Life" button, and on the right was the "Choose A Different Life" button. Unfortunately, Aidan's right hand was already against the wall to push the toilet paper. As Aidan froze at the sudden appearance of the reveal, the "Choose A Different Life" button, which overlapped with his right hand, naturally reacted.
----
[op_12]
----
And after going through character creation and other processes, Aidan was sent to the dormitory for the crew of the "Spaceship Poraporapora Existence Awareness Fleet." Memories of continuously practicing manzai, dreaming of the "Mountain" series as a papaya salad brother, memories of "Mountain God's" papaya salad that was just overwhelmingly spicy, and memories of diligently studying for entrance exams to enter the training school were all mixed up. Aidan had no sense of reality about being there, but he could smoothly perform the series of actions of returning to the dormitory and lying down on the bed.
----

[op_17]
----
Layla, Caitlyn, and Max told the awakened Aidan about human extinction, and Gideon told him about sushi, the means to prevent human extinction. Although the conversation almost turned to what sushi was, they decided to think about it once everyone was awake, and the five of them waited for the next crew member to wake up. And the next to wake up was Bella. The moment Bella appeared in the lobby where the five were waiting, the spaceship suddenly began to move slowly.
----
[op_16]
----
During the "Sequential Awakening Phase," absolute stillness was the rule for the spaceship, and including Bella who had just woken up, there were 6 crew members awake. The remaining 18 — Cora, Dalia, Edgar, Fynn, Haku, Jasper, Naira, Oscar, Patrick, Quincy, Rowan, Sid, Theo, Ulric, Victor, Willow, Xavier, and Zoe — were still in cold sleep. The moment the spaceship began to move, Caitlyn checked the lobby's stop control lock system. Upon confirming that the lock lever was positioned somewhere between the lowest and second lowest marks, Caitlyn pulled the lever all the way down. With a click, the spaceship stopped. Layla whistled and winked. Since the "Poraporapora" had failed its landing, it might have experienced unusual shaking and stress. The six concluded that this was the reason the spaceship moved and the cause of the lock lever's position.

After the commotion over the spaceship's stop control lock subsided, Layla, Caitlyn, and Max told the awakened Bella about human extinction, and Gideon told her about sushi, the means to prevent human extinction. While listening to the story of human extinction, Bella appeared perfectly calm, unlike Aidan. However, when Gideon began to talk about the means to save humanity from extinction, Bella's expression turned quizzical. The moment she heard that the means to prevent human extinction was "sushi," Bella's eyes widened, and she completely froze.

Bella's parents were, objectively speaking, fraudulent fortune tellers. From Bella's childhood, they would preach about human extinction, inciting fear, and claiming that worldly possessions were meaningless, they would extort money under the guise of donations, living lavishly themselves. If information were to be added for Bella's parents' honor, a great many people engaged in such activities taking advantage of the milestone year 200,000,000 A.D., and many of them came from less affluent families, so there was also an atmosphere in society that implicitly condoned their activities as a form of charity. As a result, Bella herself was able to receive a reasonably decent education, and she held a detached view of life regarding her parents' work and her own benefited existence. Bella herself believed that her parents were her parents, and she was herself, and after adulthood, she took a job as a regional transit correspondent, which had almost no relation to fortune-telling.

The job of a regional transit correspondent around 200,000,000 A.D. was, in reality, to patrol fixed routes using fixed modes of transport and verify whether predefined changes were occurring. The terminals issued to regional transit correspondents had constantly active sensors that monitored the surrounding conditions, separate from the items the correspondent themselves input, and were designed to transmit information to the Mother Computer. In Bella's own perception, it was a job where she could travel wherever she liked, like an explorer, but in reality, like various other jobs existing in this era, most outcomes were predetermined. In any case, Bella traveled through various regions, helped novice parties, encountered glowing prophecy books and scientists living in ruins, defeated a demon king, and ultimately came to believe with certainty that "human extinction is real." From Bella's perspective, she realized that her parents had been telling the truth, but the act of propagating something without evidence to gain money, whether it was true or complete nonsense, was equally fraudulent to Bella. Bella still didn't grasp the exact timing or specific events of human extinction, but she judged that being on Earth at that specific time in 200,000,000 A.D. carried a risk, so Bella decided to enroll in the "Spaceship Poraporapora Existence Awareness Fleet" crew training school.

For Bella, human extinction was an inescapable event that she had become convinced of through various pieces of information, and the act of preventing human extinction was an inconceivable idea. The specific means, "sushi," was something Bella had never heard of, even as someone who had traveled through various regions as a regional transit correspondent, but she thought, "It's a little intriguing." Here too, the conversation almost turned to what sushi was, but they decided to think about it once everyone was awake, and the six of them waited for the next crew member to wake up.

The next to wake up in the "Sequential Awakening Phase" was Cora. The awakened crew members gave Cora a similar explanation, and Cora had a similar reaction. Again, the conversation almost turned to what sushi was, but they decided to think about it once everyone was awake, and the seven of them waited for the next crew member to wake up.

Next to wake up was Dalia. Before becoming a crew member, Dalia worked at a town bakery. Her specialty bread was croissants. The bakery where Dalia worked was located in a quiet residential area, a little away from the city center, and its small brick building, intertwined with ivy, gave it a charming impression. From early morning, the savory scent of baking bread filled the town, and for the local residents, that smell had become a part of their daily lives.

Dalia's croissants were crispy on the outside, moist on the inside, and rich in butter flavor. Their deliciousness became famous among the townspeople, and some people traveled from afar specifically for Dalia's croissants. Eventually, a customer claiming to be a sage who had reincarnated several times and retired came, and to protect the diversity of bread in the world, Dalia ended up creating a special bread. She obtained a large sum of money through stock manipulation to acquire yeast made from dragon's saliva, and the special bread she somehow created gained self-awareness and swapped places with Dalia. The sage took the special bread out on a rainy day for sealing, and eventually, Dalia acquired the ability to stop time. Only once a month, Dalia could stop time around her for about a week. However, since Dalia's own time also stopped, Dalia herself didn't truly understand the nature of her time-stopping ability.

The awakened crew members gave Dalia a similar explanation. Dalia also had a similar reaction. Again, the conversation almost turned to what sushi was, but they decided to think about it once everyone was awake, and the eight of them waited for the next crew member to wake up.

Chapter 1 ~Awakening~

[op_0]
----
The four crew members already awake from "Manned Observation Time" - Layla, Gideon, Caitlyn, and Max - and the four who had woken up during the "Sequential Awakening Phase" - Aidan, Bella, Cora, and Dalia, making a total of eight, were waiting in the spaceship's lobby for Edgar, who was expected to wake up next. Until then, the pace was such that the next crew member would awaken fairly quickly if the already awakened crew members and the newly awakened crew members engaged in casual conversation or lingered on the topic of human extinction. However, even after they had finished all such discussions and the frequency of pauses in conversation increased, there was still no sign of Edgar waking up. The reason this period felt long might also be influenced by the difference in the frequency of "Manned Observation Time" overlap between Dalia, who woke up last, and the previous seven, which made the conversation slightly awkward. However, even discounting such psychological reasons, the actual time it took for Edgar to wake up was considerably longer than for the previous four.
