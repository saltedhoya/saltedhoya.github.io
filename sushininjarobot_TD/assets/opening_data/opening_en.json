    "In the year 200,000,003 AD, the spaceship Poraporapora, carrying Aidan, Bella, Cora, Dahlia, Edgar, Finn, Gideon, Haku, Jasper, Katelyn, Laila, Max, Nyla, Oscar, Patrick, Quincy, Rowan, Sid, Theo, Ulric, Victor, Willow, Xavier, and Zoe, was on its return voyage to Earth.The Poraporapora was the second vessel of the \"Spaceship Poraporapora Existence Awareness Fleet,\" a fleet created to broadcast the Poraporapora's existence across the universe.The mission was scheduled to last 400 days—a very long journey away from Earth for over a year—but its end was finally just around the corner.",
    "The greatest challenge for the crew during the long voyage was the rotating \"Manned Surveillance Shifts.\"Most of that time was spent re-examining data generated by machines, making mental fortitude a crucial key to surviving the long journey through space.To suppress mental turmoil, the crew of the Poraporapora needed one thing above all else: entertainment.A game that became popular among the crew just in the nick of time was \"Modified Rock-Paper-Scissors.\"The rules are the same as the classic game, and the following is the win-loss record from a league tournament the crew held during one of their surveillance shifts.",
    "[op_2]",
    "This tournament took place during the 703rd Manned Surveillance Shift, with Laila, Gideon, Katelyn, and Max participating.In the win-loss table, 1 is Laila, 2 is Gideon, 3 is Katelyn, and 4 is Max.In this round, Laila and Katelyn were tied, so they were engaged in a final showdown to determine the first-place winner.",
    "At that moment, among the four on the bridge, it was Max who first noticed an anomaly with the spaceship.Gideon and Max had been watching the final match, but after a few hours, they lost interest in the outcome.They glanced down at their consoles to proceed with the now-routine task of checking the instruments.What the ship's gauges showed were values so abnormal they were instantly recognizable as a problem.",
    "[op_3]",
    "Max points to an instrument panel and shouts something.Gideon glances at Laila and Katelyn, still engrossed in their game, before turning his gaze to the panel Max is pointing at.In Gideon's line of sight, a red warning light flashes, and the propulsion system's output is far below normal levels.Multiple error messages scroll across the instrument panel's display.",
    "Gideon leaned closer to the panel, straining his eyes to read the error codes.Each was just a string of letters and numbers, but it was clear they signified a dire situation.A bead of sweat trickled down Gideon's forehead. The Poraporapora had traveled for 400 days, the entire planned duration of the voyage, with almost no trouble.Earth was just ahead. He couldn't wrap his head around an anomaly of this magnitude happening now.",
    "Max reached for the red emergency button on the wall. He slammed it without hesitation, and a deafening alarm blared throughout the ship.Simultaneously, an automated announcement began to play from the ceiling speakers. The dispassionate voice reporting an emergency sent a fresh wave of tension through the vessel.Laila and Katelyn were still playing Modified Rock-Paper-Scissors.",
    "[op_4]",
    "Though the emergency button had been pressed, the Poraporapora was already close enough to Earth to land safely.",
    "[op_5]",
    "After landing, the Poraporapora initiated the \"Sequential Wake-up Phase.\" It was time for the crew members other than Laila, Gideon, Katelyn, and Max—who were already awake for their shift—to be roused from cold sleep.Aidan, Bella, Cora, Dahlia, Edgar, Finn, Haku, Jasper, Nyla, Oscar, Patrick, Quincy, Rowan, Sid, Theo, Ulric, Victor, Willow, Xavier, and Zoe would now be awakened in order.Typically, each crew member remained in cold sleep until their assigned surveillance shift, so moments when the entire crew was awake simultaneously were exceedingly rare.They had all been awake together only twice: when the Poraporapora left Earth, and now, upon its return.After the eventful landing, everyone woke up safely, underwent medical examinations, filed their reports, and returned to their respective duties on Earth.",
    "[op_0]",
    "Shortly before the Poraporapora's landing, a revolving sushi restaurant was undergoing its final pre-opening adjustments.Ever since the concept of \"sushi\" was unearthed from the Mother History restoration project in the year 200,000,002 AD, Earth's culinary institutions had been buzzing with excitement over the first rediscovery of a dish in centuries.Rebuilding revolving sushi restaurants was deemed an urgent priority. Over the past year, data had been analyzed to reconstruct sushi's cooking, serving, and billing methods.The existence of a \"God-awful Useless Practice Session\" was also discovered—a preliminary serving for Earth's officials before the restaurant opened to the public. This practice session would be the restaurant's true maiden voyage.",
    "The restaurant's interior exuded an air of cleanliness, with a brand-new white wood counter and a conveyor belt flowing through its center.Nothing was on the belt yet; it rotated silently, empty.Like the veins of a futuristic city, its movement was regular and inorganic.",
    "[op_6]",
    "In the kitchen, several chefs in white uniforms were preparing sushi with intense focus.Their hand movements were so fluid and precise it was hard to believe they were ancient techniques recreated from data analysis.Squid, bananas, cake, tomatoes. Colorful toppings were sliced vividly with sharpened knives.Their motions were flawless, like those of artisans who had been making sushi for decades.",
    "The servers, dressed in white blouses and black skirts—another restored ancient uniform—waited nervously for the guests to arrive.It was their first day, and they mentally recited the customer service manual they had practiced over and over, taking deep breaths.",
    "A large screen on the restaurant wall prominently displayed the words: \"God-awful Useless Practice Session.\"Below it, in smaller letters, \"For Earth Officials Only.\"A bizarre name, but it was the exact notation excavated from ancient data.",
    "[op_7]",
    "When the time came, a heavy door opened, and several Earth officials in black suits entered.Following what were believed to be restored ancient rules, none of the servers greeted them upon entry.Only after the officials were seated did the servers bow in unison, offering a greeting in a restored ancient language.The officials, who had also practiced the rules, returned the greeting in the same ancient tongue.They had rehearsed how to eat \"sushi,\" but like the staff, they wore tense expressions for their first real tasting.Incidentally, the officials' biggest struggle was holding the chopsticks.",
    "In front of the officials' seats, a stream of scalding hot tea flowed endlessly, like a waterfall.This, too, was a restored ancient rule.Above it ran the conveyor belt for the sushi.All that was left was for the sushi to arrive.The officials ate the various strange toppings that flowed by with astonishment. After a series of accidents, the \"God-awful Useless Practice Session\" ended in failure. As a result, two days later, humanity perished.The timeline of events was: \"God-awful Useless Practice Session\" -> Poraporapora Landing -> Extinction of Humanity.",
    "[op_0]",
    "After all of humanity was wiped out, the Mother Computer naturally began to initiate its time-reversal routine for the nth time.A lamp near the Mother Computer, located in the Mother Computer Room designed to house the Mother Computer, began to flicker.Though no human had ever realized it, by communicating with the \"outside,\" the Mother Computer was already capable of feats considered theoretically impossible in this world, such as time reversal and time suspension.",
    "[op_8]",
    "Time reversal came with two options. The first was \"Overwrite,\" which would copy the current memory information directly onto the Mother Computer of the destination timeline.The second was \"Save As,\" which would generate the time-reversed world as a new, separate parallel universe.The right to choose belonged to the Mother Computer. Humanity, unaware of the time-reversal function's existence, let alone its options, had no say in the matter.Whether past history would be altered or a new world would be born was an event far beyond human comprehension.After the Mother Computer made its choice, humanity, already extinct, had no way of knowing what would follow.Humanity was on the verge of another time reversal, completely oblivious.Countless humans had imagined time travel in novels and stories, but not a single one knew that, just next door, separated by a thin wall, the Mother Computer was ready to execute it at any moment.In the end, humanity could perform time reversal, but the fact that no one knew it was possible was perhaps the greatest irony of all.If humanity had known of this power before their extinction, they might have used the Mother Computer to try and turn back time.But now, at the very moment the Mother Computer was attempting it, humanity was already gone.At this point, humanity was utterly incapable of using the Mother Computer to initiate time reversal, for the simple and overwhelming reason that the entity known as \"humanity\" was extinct.(As an aside, since a Mother Computer exists on each timeline, it wasn't uncommon for them to have different names. While sometimes it was just \"Mother Computer,\" the official name on this world line was the \"General-Purpose, Ultra-Long-Range, Subspace-Communication-Network-Connected, Planetary-Scale Quantum Computer Network with Excellent Cost-Performance, pursuant to Article 66, Paragraph 3, Item 2 of the Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Non-Aggression between the Earth Federation and the Planetary Union, for the maintenance of permanent peace between the 28 star systems of the Earth Federation and the 32 star systems of the Planetary Union, and the Status of Forces Agreement concerning planetary-scale electronic computers among the Allied Powers, and the implementation of the agreement on the status of electronic computer resources in each Allied Power,\" which was one of the longer names among the timelines. However, the longest name was over 100 times longer than this one.)",
    "[op_8]",
    "In the end, the Mother Computer decided to choose between \"Overwrite\" and \"Save As\" by flipping a coin.It created and ran a program that would randomly output one of the two options with a 50/50 probability.\"Save As\" was the result.The Mother Computer pretended not to see it and inserted the punch card for the \"Overwrite\" option.Time reversal began.The Mother Computer had been thinking of going back about 100 million years, but this time, on a whim, it chose one week.",
    "[op_1]",
    "Time rewinds to the 703rd Manned Surveillance Shift aboard the spaceship Poraporapora.The crew on duty—Laila, Gideon, Katelyn, and Max—are in the middle of a Modified Rock-Paper-Scissors tournament.",
    "[op_2]",
    "Just as in the previous timeline, Laila and Katelyn were tied, so they were having a final match to decide the winner.Laila clasped her hands, peeking through the gap to anticipate her opponent's next move.Katelyn had been playing nothing but rock for the last five turns and had already decided to play rock again.Max watched them, his expression clearly showing he wished they would just finish.Gideon was confused.",
    "Time reversal by the Mother Computer has a side effect.Since no human has ever perceived a time reversal since the dawn of this world, no one can perceive its side effects either.The side effect is that, during an \"Overwrite,\" fragments of memory from the previous timeline can rarely get mixed in with the new one.It's like the memory of a dream, which fades quickly after waking.However, the reversal period the Mother Computer had chosen on a whim this time was \"three days.\"It was pure coincidence, but it was the first time in history that the Mother Computer had used the \"Overwrite\" option to travel back to an era advanced enough to access it.",
    "Gideon retained a memory of humanity's extinction—or more accurately, the moments just before it.And the crew of the spaceship Poraporapora were among the few humans with access rights to the Mother Computer.Using a terminal, Gideon asked the Mother Computer about his memory of the apocalypse.The Mother Computer confirmed that the extinction was a fact.Gideon's next question was how to stop it.The Mother Computer's answer was: \"Sushi.\"",
    "[op_0]",
    "Katelyn was once the monarch of the small nation of Pokupokuchin.While Pokupokuchin was one of the \"nation games\" left on Earth, Katelyn had never doubted her royal lineage until she turned fifty.Then, on her fiftieth birthday, the truth was revealed.The nation was just a game. She was given a choice: continue playing, or live a different life of her own choosing.For someone who had lived in poverty, choosing a different life for a wealthy retirement would have been a foregone conclusion.But Katelyn was born into royalty and had already experienced a life free of want. Statistically, most in her position chose to continue the game.But Katelyn chose the outside world.She pressed the right button on the unscientific selection terminal that had suddenly appeared before her.",
    "[op_9]",
    "According to Gutenberg's principle, people's eyes tend to move from top-left to bottom-right. Placing a button on the left makes it easier to find with a natural sweep of the eyes.For the designer of the game's reveal function, it must have seemed natural that most people would select \"Choose a different life.\"It makes sense. By the time you're fifty and have turned a corner in life, most people carry regrets.For them, \"choosing a different life\" was nothing but a bonus.In fact, pressing the left button, \"Continue your life so far,\" was designed to trigger a confirmation pop-up: \"Are you sure you want to continue your life so far?\"However, after a design review by a bespectacled superior who insisted it was better to give people a free choice, the left and right buttons were forced to have the same color and text weight.As a result, Katelyn, without much thought, simply assumed the right button meant \"Next\" and chose it.It was the \"Choose a different life\" button.",
    "[op_10]",
    "And so, Katelyn was transported to a character creation world.In her shock, she pressed the randomize button twice and found she couldn't return to her default appearance.Now with a neck longer than her legs, Katelyn struggled, manually adjusting her character to resemble her original self.After an hour of meticulous tweaks, she was finally satisfied. As she was about to press \"Complete,\" she accidentally hit the randomize button again.Giving up, Katelyn changed her character's gender and moved on.",
    "[op_0]",
    "Katelyn was then sent to the training academy for the crew of the \"Spaceship Poraporapora Existence Awareness Ship.\"It was called an academy, but the curriculum consisted of only a brief lecture after the entrance ceremony, with practical training starting that same afternoon.The academy grounds alone were half the size of Pokupokuchin, and most people had only ever seen the world outside of it in videos.Katelyn tried to remember why she was here.Memories swirled together: decades of ruling as the monarch of Pokupokuchin, an hour of struggle in the character creation world, and studying hard for the entrance exam to this academy.Her sense of self felt unreal, yet she could check the spaceship's instruments with perfect smoothness.",
    "[op_11]",
    "The story rewinds a bit, to the design phase of the \"nation game\" system on Earth, which included Pokupokuchin.This grand leisure system, which 99% of all humanity at the time would experience, was designed by a young designer in the role of a \"serious subordinate\" and a glasses-wearing designer in the role of a \"bespectacled boss,\" both appointed within a \"work game.\"The subordinate designer believed both the left \"Continue your life so far\" button and the right \"Choose a different life\" button were important, and proposed using different colors to make the choice clear.But the glasses-wearing designer repeatedly offered subjective rebuttals.In the end, just as the glasses-wearer wanted, the two buttons became flat designs of the exact same color.The young designer, in his despair, conceived of humanity's extinction.And the glasses-wearing designer, to evade responsibility, conceived of a way to save it.",
    "[op_12]",
    "The dormitories for the crew of the \"Spaceship Poraporapora Existence Awareness Ship\" were built surrounding a courtyard with a ridiculously large bronze statue of the glasses-wearing designer.Everyone attending the academy had heard of him.They were told the story of the hero who would save the world from extinction during the brief lecture after the entrance ceremony.The most disturbing part was that the glasses-wearing designer was still alive.And so, Katelyn, having completed her practical training in a dreamlike state immediately after the game's reveal, returned to her dormitory.",
    "[op_13]",
    "When Katelyn returned to her room, she found a dazzling, flashing light in the corner, twin green slimes on the table, and a slowly moving, human-shaped stain on the bed.To Katelyn, the room felt like it half-belonged to someone else. It was possible she simply couldn't remember spending yesterday with these... things, due to her confused memories. So she tried to act as naturally as possible, as if they had always been there.Losing patience, a telepathic message was sent to her, a voice flowed from the room's speakers, and letter-like shapes began to appear on the wall.As Katelyn deciphered each, she realized the telepathy came from the human-shaped stain, the voice from the green slimes, and the writing on the wall from the light.The three entities, each with their own intentions, had tried to contact Katelyn, and by sheer coincidence, had all appeared in her room at the same time.",
    "Until Katelyn's return, the light, the green slimes, and the stain had all assumed the others were just peculiar pieces of interior decor. Upon learning through Katelyn that they could communicate, they fell into a state of mutual suspicion.However, after resolving a few common troubles, rescuing a kidnapped companion, and gradually building trust, Katelyn and the three beings were finally able to summarize the situation on a whiteboard.",
    "[op_14]",
    "First, the light identified itself not as a native of this world, but as a being from another parallel world, one forced to shrink by the expansion of others, including the current universe.The light explained that it had observed its own world's domain vanishing at an unnatural rate and had attempted to contact this world, which was born at the very moment that triggered the decline.",
    "The green slimes explained that in their home world, many monsters were being invaded by humans. They had warped to this world to do something about the threat to their species.The warp required the sacrifice of one green slime, but they couldn't choose which one. So, the two smartest twin slimes were chosen to make the journey.Apparently, a childhood friend's tears and an ancient necklace spilled during the ritual allowed them both to warp successfully.",
    "The stain introduced itself as having once been called \"The Beatles,\" and said it existed to bring about world peace through music.However, it claimed to have no idea why it had appeared in Katelyn's room or what it was supposed to do.",
    "Katelyn had a feeling the stain was probably telling the truth.It was just a hunch, a remnant of her memories as the monarch of Pokupokuchin.",
    "[op_15]",
    "Just as Katelyn finished summarizing the three beings' explanations on the whiteboard and was about to go for a quick drink, two of the crew's emergency buzzers in her room blared.One buzzer meant a minor emergency. Two meant a major one. Since the dormitory's construction, three had never rung at once.Katelyn's room phone rang.It was the signal for the emergency launch of the second ship of the \"Spaceship Poraporapora Existence Awareness Fleet\"—the spaceship Poraporapora itself.",

    "[op_3]",
    "Max pointed at the instrument panel and shouted something.Gideon glanced at Laila and Katelyn, still playing their game, then turned his gaze to the panel Max was pointing at.He saw a flashing red warning light and a propulsion system output far below normal.Gideon was strangely calm. *Same as the last timeline,* he thought.Multiple error messages scrolled across the instrument panel's display.",
    "Gideon leaned closer to the panel to read the error codes. Same as last time.The way to save humanity from extinction, the Mother Computer had said, was \"sushi.\"But Gideon had no idea what \"sushi\" meant, and he doubted the other crew members would believe him if he said, \"Humanity is ending in a few days.\"In these situations, the most persuasive method of negotiation with the people of this era was to have the Mother Computer explain it for you.",
    "Max reached for the red emergency button on the wall.He was about to press it without hesitation, sounding a deafening alarm and triggering an automated, inorganic voice to announce the emergency, sending tension through the ship.Gideon stopped him.",
    "[op_3]",
    "Max questioned Gideon for ordering a response that deviated from the manual. Gideon replied that he would explain shortly.Laila and Katelyn were still playing Modified Rock-Paper-Scissors, so Gideon took a breath to call out and stop them.He called out to them lightly. They stopped their game.",
    "In front of the three, Gideon asked the Mother Computer about the extinction of humanity.The Mother Computer spoke of two things: that humanity would be destroyed in a few days, and that the means to stop it was \"sushi.\"Max, Laila, and Katelyn were stunned by the sheer volume of information.For Gideon, who had already experienced the apocalypse once, the crucial information was that the means to stop it was sushi.But for the other three, the shock of \"humanity will be destroyed in a few days\" was so great they couldn't process the situation.Gideon looked at their slack-jawed faces and felt a pang of communication failure.Perhaps it would have been better to explain it himself at this stage, rather than having it come from the Mother Computer.In any case, they had to make an emergency landing. Gideon yelled the emergency landing procedures to Max, Laila, and Katelyn.Snapping back to reality, the three went to their stations as per the manual, but their confusion was still visible.The Poraporapora drew closer to Earth, and alarms blared from the ship's instruments. Laila gripped the control stick tighter.Due to their nervousness, the emergency landing failed, but all crew members survived.",
    "[op_16]",
    "After landing, just as in the previous timeline from Gideon's perspective, the Poraporapora entered the \"Sequential Wake-up Phase.\" It was time for the crew members other than Laila, Gideon, Katelyn, and Max—who were already awake—to be roused.Aidan, Bella, Cora, Dahlia, Edgar, Finn, Haku, Jasper, Nyla, Oscar, Patrick, Quincy, Rowan, Sid, Theo, Ulric, Victor, Willow, Xavier, and Zoe would be awakened in order.The first to wake would be Aidan. The four of them waited in the ship's lobby, which was tilted from the failed landing.Laila, Katelyn, and Max were agonizing over how to break the news of humanity's doom to the rest of the crew.Gideon was thinking about sushi, the key to preventing it.",
    "[op_0]",
    "[op_17]",
    "The first to wake up was Aidan. Aidan was once the brother of a Papaya Salad.The papaya salad shop \"Mountain God\" was a famous establishment near the Earth Federation Headquarters, close to a pond renowned for its clear spring water.Papaya salad shops were a new type of eatery that emerged around the year 200,000,000 AD. They were mobile stalls, pulled by hand while a trumpet blared.When a crowd gathered at the sound of the trumpet, the proprietor would serve them free papaya salad.While the customers ate, the proprietor would perform a comedic monologue sponsored by advertisers. That was the business model.\"Mountain God\" was a franchise of the original \"Mountain,\" the shop that gave birth to the legendary papaya salad brother, \"Takahashi.\"\"Takahashi\" was said to be the first papaya salad brother to begin his act with a new monologue, the so-called \"new work start,\" whereas his predecessors had always started with the sponsored material.Since the income of a papaya salad shop came from performing the sponsored monologue, the backlash from the industry at the time was immense.But ultimately, the \"new work start\" trend that began with \"Takahashi\" sparked the first papaya salad boom and greatly contributed to raising the status of all papaya salad brothers.As a result, the \"Mountain\" chain was known for having an exceptionally high level of papaya salad brothers. Their four-minute audition monologue was famously unforgiving—one slip-up meant certain failure. It was also well-known that, to counter cheating via a speaker hidden in the mouth playing a pre-recorded monologue, there was a rule to apply a stun gun to the throat before the audition.Aidan was a low-tier papaya salad brother who admired \"Takahashi God,\" the top brother at \"Mountain God,\" and had taken a job at a nameless local papaya salad shop.Despite never having auditioned for the \"Mountain\" chain, Aidan had practiced performing his monologue after being tased so many times that he had developed a remarkable tolerance for stun guns.",
    "[op_19]",
    "One day, Aidan went to \"Mountain God\" to eat papaya salad, as he often did.Of course, he didn't work there; he was just a customer.His goal was to see several papaya salad brothers, including \"Takahashi God.\"Even among the \"Mountain\" chain, the papaya salad at \"Mountain God\" had more papaya and fewer green beans than usual.The amounts of cherry tomatoes, peanuts, dried shrimp, and garlic were the same as the chain's secret recipe, but the distinctive feature of \"Mountain God\" was the chili pepper.The amount was drastically increased from the secret recipe; it was no exaggeration to say it was nearly 4.5 times the normal amount.The fire-breathing papaya on the \"Mountain God\" sign served as a warning of its spiciness.",
    "[op_18]",
    "Aidan brought the papaya salad to his lips. Instantly, a sharp pain shot through his mouth.It felt as if his mouth was on fire. His tongue went numb, his throat burned.The intense spiciness was a merciless assault on his taste buds.His brain screamed danger signals. But Aidan swallowed the papaya salad.The moment he did, he felt a heat surge up from his stomach, as if magma were boiling inside him. He couldn't help but cough, and with each cough, hot breath escaped his lips like a small flamethrower. Tears streamed from his eyes, and his nose ran uncontrollably.His face turned beet red, and sweat beaded on his forehead.Aidan couldn't imagine how awful he looked. He just wanted the intense pain to stop.He fumbled with the cap of the water bottle he'd been given, opened it with one hand, and chugged it. But the water felt like boiling liquid.The spiciness didn't subside; if anything, the heat intensified.He tried to drink more water, but his hand trembled.His breathing was ragged, his heart pounded like a drum, as if he'd just finished a marathon.But far from being tired, his body felt strangely energized. It was an abnormal excitement, born from pain.Though Aidan had eaten the \"Mountain God\" papaya salad many times, he had a low tolerance for spice.",
    "[op_20]",
    "In his spice-induced delirium, Aidan listened to the comedy routine of \"Takahashi God\" unfolding before him.It was a classic bit Aidan had heard many times, but today it sounded different.Each word \"Takahashi God\" spoke was being reassembled in Aidan's brain like a cipher.It was a level of understanding only accessible to someone like Aidan, who had lived as a papaya salad brother for years.The classic routine, famous in the \"Mountain\" chain, was called \"The Recipe.\"It was a monologue about a secret papaya salad recipe, but it seemed to be more than just a metaphor; it felt like it was pointing to a specific location.The origin of the papaya, the blend of seasonings, the arrangement of the cooking utensils—everything \"Takahashi God\" mentioned connected in Aidan's mind like a map, pointing to a single, specific place.It pointed to the heart of papaya salad, and the location of a treasure hidden by \"Takahashi God.\"In his hazy consciousness, Aidan became certain of where it was.He didn't know what was there, but he was gripped by a powerful, irresistible urge to go.It was a force like fate, impossible to defy.He intuitively understood that this place held the key to unlocking the truth of papaya salad and would also be a place that would change his own life forever.\"Takahashi God's\" monologue was no longer just entertainment; for Aidan, it had become a life-altering revelation.Silently, within his mind, Aidan began to prepare for the journey.It signified the beginning of a new chapter in his life as a papaya salad brother.",
    "[op_21]",
    "Leaving \"Mountain God,\" Aidan headed for the public restroom located between the shop and the famous world heritage site, the \"Papaya Pyramid.\"His primary purpose was to relieve himself, but the location of the treasure he'd divined from \"The Recipe\" was this very restroom.Aidan took care of his business, then looked around.",
    "[op_22]",
    "The view from the toilet stall was just that of a toilet.For a normal person, it was a mundane, everyday scene. But Aidan was confident he was closing in on the heart of the treasure.However, he couldn't recall any further hints from \"The Recipe\" monologue.He tried knocking on the wall. Nothing.He tried stomping his heels loudly on the floor. Nothing.He looked up at the ceiling, then slowly pushed the toilet paper dispenser on the wall.The toilet paper dispenser slowly receded into the wall.",
    "[op_9]",
    "In that instant, the truth was revealed to Aidan.Suddenly, the reveal UI appeared before him.On the left, the \"Continue your life so far\" button; on the right, the \"Choose a different life\" button.Unfortunately, Aidan's right hand was already on the wall from pushing the dispenser.As he froze at the sudden interface, his right hand, already overlapping with the \"Choose a different life\" button, naturally triggered it.",
    "[op_12]",
    "And so, after a character creation sequence, Aidan was sent to the dormitory for the crew of the \"Spaceship Poraporapora Existence Awareness Ship.\"His memories were a jumble: practicing monologues as a papaya salad brother dreaming of the \"Mountain\" chain, the memory of the unbearably spicy papaya salad from \"Mountain God,\" and the memory of studying hard for the entrance exam to the academy.Aidan felt no sense of reality in his current self, but the motion of returning to the dorm and lying down on the bed was performed smoothly.",
    "[op_0]",
    "[op_17]",
    "Laila, Katelyn, and Max told the newly awakened Aidan about the impending doom of humanity, while Gideon told him about sushi, the means to prevent it.The conversation was about to turn to what sushi was, but they decided to discuss it after everyone was awake. The five of them decided to wait for the next crew member.The next to awaken was Bella. The moment she appeared in the lobby where the five were waiting, the spaceship suddenly began to move slowly.",
    "[op_16]",
    "During the \"Sequential Wake-up Phase,\" the spaceship was supposed to be under absolute lockdown. Including the newly awakened Bella, there were now six conscious crew members.The remaining eighteen—Cora, Dahlia, Edgar, Finn, Haku, Jasper, Nyla, Oscar, Patrick, Quincy, Rowan, Sid, Theo, Ulric, Victor, Willow, Xavier, and Zoe—were still in cold sleep.The moment the ship moved, Katelyn checked the lobby's stop control lock system.Seeing the lock lever positioned halfway between the lowest and second-lowest marks, Katelyn pulled it all the way down.With a click, the spaceship stopped.Laila whistled and winked.Perhaps the failed landing had subjected the \"Poraporapora\" to unusual stress and vibrations.The six of them concluded that this was the reason the ship had moved and the lever had been displaced.",
    "[op_17]",
    "After the commotion with the ship's lock system died down, Laila, Katelyn, and Max told the awakened Bella about the destruction of humanity, and Gideon told her about sushi, the means to prevent it.Unlike Aidan, Bella seemed perfectly calm while listening to the story of the apocalypse.But when Gideon began to speak of the means to save humanity, Bella's expression turned skeptical.The moment she heard that the key to preventing humanity's extinction was \"sushi,\" Bella's eyes widened, and she froze completely.",
    "[op_23]",
    "Objectively speaking, Bella's parents were charlatan fortune-tellers.Since Bella was a child, they had preached about the end of the world to incite fear, claiming worldly possessions were meaningless while soliciting donations to fund their own lavish lifestyle.To be fair to them, many people engaged in such activities around the milestone year of 200,000,000 AD. Since many came from less affluent families, society tended to tacitly condone their activities as a form of charity.Thanks to this, Bella received a decent education and developed a philosophical detachment towards her parents' work and the benefits she reaped from it.Bella always believed her parents were her parents, and she was herself. After coming of age, she took a job as a Regional Traffic Correspondent, a profession completely unrelated to fortune-telling.",

    "The job of a Regional Traffic Correspondent around 200,000,000 AD was, in practice, to patrol a predetermined route using a predetermined mode of transport and confirm if predetermined changes had occurred.The terminal issued to correspondents had a constantly active sensor that monitored the surroundings and sent data to the Mother Computer, separate from the items the correspondent entered manually.In Bella's mind, it was a job where she could travel wherever she liked, like an explorer. In reality, like many other jobs of that era, the outcome was largely predetermined.The \"nation game\" reveal happened to Bella while she was working as a correspondent, but she was content enough with her life to choose the \"Continue your life so far\" button.In any case, Bella traveled to various regions, assisted beginner parties, encountered continuously glowing books of prophecy and scientists living in ruins, defeated a demon lord, and ultimately became convinced that \"humanity's extinction is real.\"From Bella's perspective, this meant her parents had been telling the truth. But for her, profiting from baseless fear-mongering was fraud, whether the claims were true or false.Although Bella didn't know the exact timing or details of the extinction, she judged that being on Earth at that specific time in 200,000,000 AD was a risk. Of her own volition, she enrolled in the training academy for the \"Spaceship Poraporapora Existence Awareness Ship.\"",

The idea of preventing it was completely foreign to her.The specific method, \"sushi,\" was something she had never heard of, even with all her travels as a Regional Traffic Correspondent. But, she thought, it was a little intriguing.Here too, the conversation was about to turn to what sushi was, but they decided to wait until everyone was awake.

To protect the diversity of the world's bread, Dahlia was tasked with creating a special loaf.To obtain the yeast made from dragon's saliva, she manipulated the stock market to get a large sum of money. The special bread she managed to create gained sentience and switched places with her. The sage, in an attempt to seal it, took the special bread out on a rainy day. Through these events, Dahlia eventually acquired the ability to stop time.Once a month, for about a week, Dahlia could stop the time around her.However, since her own time also stopped, Dahlia herself never truly understood this ability.",

    "The eight of them—Laila, Gideon, Katelyn, and Max, who were already awake for the Manned Surveillance Shift, plus Aidan, Bella, Cora, and Dahlia, who had been roused during the Sequential Wake-up Phase—waited in the spaceship's lobby for Edgar, the next crew member scheduled to wake.Up until now, the next person had usually woken up quickly, the interval filled with light chat or discussion about the lingering shock of humanity's extinction.But this time, even after the conversation had died down and the lulls grew more frequent, there was still no sign of Edgar.The wait felt longer, perhaps because the conversation was slightly stilted; Dahlia, the last to wake, had shared fewer surveillance shifts with the other seven.But even accounting for that, the time it was taking for Edgar to wake was genuinely, significantly longer than it had been for the others.",
    "[op_26]",
    "After several quiet spells, it was Gideon who finally broke the silence.No one in the currently-awake crew knew the word \"sushi,\" or anything that could even hint at its meaning.Gideon proposed that, assuming no one else waking up would know what it was either, it would be stressful for everyone to be bombarded with the same questions over and over.In other words, he suggested they ask the Mother Computer about \"sushi\" right now.Several crew members, weary of the repeated questioning, agreed.Bella voiced her opinion that even if the Mother Computer provided an answer, they would have to judge its accuracy for themselves. She meant to express her skepticism about any means of preventing the apocalypse, but to the others, it sounded as if she were still in denial, unable to accept the reality of their doom out of fear.Katelyn, forcing the kindest expression she could manage, simply nodded.",

    "Around the 200th surveillance shift, Max had been checking the instruments while suffering from an upset stomach.As luck would have it, he spotted a concerning anomaly on the gauges and couldn't relax until the values returned to normal and stayed there for a while.The moment they finally stabilized, he made a mad dash for the restroom.Even in the toilet, he couldn't stop worrying that the normal readings would revert to anomalous ones.When he came out, not wanting to alarm the others, he had used the lobby terminal to check the instrument logs from while he was away.",
    "Omitting the finer details, Max mentioned he had some experience with the terminal and moved to stand before it.Gideon was grateful. So far, he was the only one who had questioned the Mother Computer about the extinction, and having another crew member operate the terminal would lend credibility to his story.As Max stood before the terminal, the hum of its fans grew louder, as if running an authentication process.Concluding that Max had legitimate access rights, the terminal's screen whirred to life with a buzz.As the other crew members watched with bated breath, Max typed, \"What is sushi?\" and hit send.",
    "[op_28]",
    "The Mother Computer's response was swift.It explained that \"sushi\" was a dish excavated during restoration work in 200,000,002 AD; that revolving sushi restaurants had been rebuilt to serve it; that its cooking, serving, and billing methods had been analyzed from excavated data over the past year; and that the \"God-awful Useless Practice Session\" had failed.The essential components of sushi, like \"neta\" (toppings), \"shari\" (rice), and \"agari\" (tea), were also displayed in order.Confused, Max looked around at the faces of the other crew members peering at the same screen.Those who met his gaze just shook their heads, their expressions a mixture of confusion and disbelief.From the phrase \"a means to prevent the destruction of humanity,\" the crew had imagined a mission codename, a weapon, or perhaps an all-knowing organization. The answer, however, was simply a dish called \"sushi.\"Gideon was among those looking on.Some of the crew, unsure what to do, glanced at him. Seeing his intense focus on the screen, the room fell silent.The text and image of \"sushi\" on the screen were identical to what the Mother Computer had shown him earlier. Only Gideon was convinced that this dish was the key to saving humanity.Max, Laila, and Katelyn had only heard the information from the Mother Computer's voice.The new information was that sushi was a dish, its details, and the failure of something called the \"God-awful Useless Practice Session.\"Gideon urged Max to ask another question.\"What must we do with sushi to prevent the extinction of humanity?\" Max typed as prompted, and sent the query.",

    "The Mother Computer's response was slow.Its processing speed was beyond human measurement; any delay had to be a problem with the communication link.While waiting, Max squinted, feeling the sunlight from the window grow stronger.Gideon noticed Max's pained expression and whipped his head toward the window.In that instant, Gideon shoved Max aside and typed into the terminal: \"Go to the past now.\"Only Gideon knew that what was happening right now was the extinction of humanity.",
    "The other crew members were startled by Gideon's sudden move, but they were more terrified by the intensifying light pouring in from the window.\"Don't look away from the screen!\" Gideon screamed.But few could obey.Gideon had no way of knowing if his desperate command, \"Go to the past,\" would actually work, or if it was even the correct procedure. But it was the only potential solution he could think of.With the apocalyptic sunlight throttling their communication speed, Gideon didn't know what would happen first: the answer to the sushi question appearing on screen, the time reversal beginning, or their complete annihilation.The room grew brighter and brighter, and the temperature inside the Poraporapora began to climb.This meant that the surface of Earth, right outside their ship, had already surpassed the adjustable temperature limits of the Poraporapora, a vessel built to withstand the rigors of space.Just as the crew's sweat of fear began to turn into sweat from the heat, the screen changed.",

    "\"Don't look away from the screen!\" Gideon yelled again.This time, his sheer ferocity froze everyone in place.Slowly, from the top of the screen, the method for saving humanity with sushi began to appear.As the room was bleached white with light, the crew desperately tried to commit the scrolling text to memory.When the text had filled about half the screen, a clock icon appeared in the bottom right corner and began to animate.The hands of the clock were spinning counter-clockwise.That animation was the last thing most of the crew members staring at the screen, including Gideon, would ever see on the Poraporapora.",

    "In the year 2000, Takahashi was boiling water in his studio apartment in Tokyo.As a typical Japanese salaryman, Takahashi woke up at the same time, took the same train, and worked in the same office every day.His life was a monotonous cycle, the days bleeding into one another.The whistle of the boiling kettle snapped him back to reality.He made a cup of instant coffee and, while sipping it, mentally organized his schedule for the day.Another ordinary day was about to begin.Mug in hand, Takahashi switched off the electric kettle and unplugged it.Next, he returned the coffee jar to the shelf and washed the now-empty mug.Placing the mug in the dish rack, he opened the fridge and took out a carton of milk.He checked the expiration date, confirmed it was fine, and put it back.Closing the fridge, he picked up the bag he kept in the corner of the room and checked for his wallet, phone, and train pass. All present.He put the bag back and opened the closet.From inside, he took out the shirt and pants he planned to wear and laid them on the bed.Next, he retrieved a tie and socks and placed them on top of the shirt.Takahashi sat on the chair beside his bed and put on his socks.Finished, he picked up the shirt and pants and got dressed.He buttoned the shirt carefully, one by one, and zipped his pants.Then, he took the tie and, looking in the mirror, knotted it around his neck.Once the tie was done, he moved to the small vanity in the corner.He styled his hair in the mirror, finishing with a touch of wax.With his grooming complete, he grabbed his bag, turned off the room light, and headed for the door.He put on his shoes in the entryway and reached for the doorknob.When he opened the door, he saw a person lying on the ground and let out a small, involuntary cry.",
    "[op_31]",
    "Someone was collapsed right in front of his door, in a position that made the excuse \"I thought it was a resident from another room\" completely untenable.Takahashi's first thought was that he really didn't want to deal with the police.He approached the fallen figure and tapped their shoulder lightly to check for consciousness.They were breathing, but there was no response.Takahashi's mind raced, considering his options if they remained unresponsive.Should he call an ambulance? Or the police?Just then, the person's eyes fluttered open.Their unfocused gaze blinked a few times before locking onto Takahashi's face.The person slowly sat up and looked around.Their clothing wasn't modern, like Takahashi was used to seeing. It was old-fashioned, almost bizarre.Takahashi stared, a sense of unease washing over him, at a loss for words.The person seemed to be trying to get their bearings.",
    "As Laila's consciousness sharpened, her blurred vision slowly came into focus.She realized she had collapsed and that an unfamiliar man was standing over her.Where was she? Why was she here? Laila had no idea.Her last memory was of the Poraporapora being engulfed in a blinding light.But strangely, she could understand what the man was saying.He seemed to be asking about her condition.*My automatic language translator must be working properly,* Laila thought.She was relieved to confirm that the function, standard issue for all humans around the year 200,000,000 AD, was still operational.At least she hadn't been thrown into a completely unknown civilization beyond humanity's contact.This could be the first clue to breaking out of this situation.The problem was that this man, Takahashi, looked like he was about to hand her over to a public authority called \"the police.\"From the fragments of his speech, she gathered that this was likely the world after Gideon's desperate \"Go to the past\" command.Revealing her existence and being placed under the surveillance of various agencies in this world seemed like a poor strategy.",
    "To Takahashi's surprise, the collapsed person spoke fluent Japanese.This was despite the fact that her features were more striking than any celebrity he'd seen on TV, not the type one would typically encounter in Japan.The person introduced herself as Laila and asked if she could have a glass of water in his room, saying she felt unwell.Takahashi wasn't careless enough to let a total stranger into his apartment, but he didn't think it was a scam either.And if this was some kind of hidden camera show, turning her away would make him look bad.She promised repeatedly that she would leave after a short rest, so he decided to let her in to talk.Figuring he couldn't just leave her alone in his room, he called his office and told them he was going to the hospital and would be taking the day off.The sudden intrusion of the extraordinary into his ordinary life left Takahashi feeling a little thrilled.",
    "[op_0]",
    "Sitting in the man's apartment, drinking water from a cup placed on a low table, Laila tried to calmly assess her situation.She hadn't been entirely comfortable when he offered her the glass of water, but to lower his guard, she had accepted it and drank from it naturally.It seemed to contain some impurities, but it was potable.",
    "[op_32]",
    "She had learned the year from her conversation with Takahashi in the hallway.If his information—the year 2000 AD—was correct, then she had traveled 199,998,003 years into the past from the world of the Poraporapora in 200,000,003 AD.There had been eight crew members, including herself, awake near the Mother Computer at that moment, but now she was alone.How far apart had they been scattered? What were the chances that any of the others had even survived the \"jump to the past\"?Laila concluded that her chances of finding another crew member in this era were slim.That meant she was the only one in this time who knew that humanity was destined for extinction in the year 200,000,003 AD.Considering a normal human lifespan, worrying about an apocalypse 200 million years in the future might seem pointless.But, as a person from the future, she felt a sense of duty to investigate and try to resolve the situation.At that moment, Laila considered two possible solutions.",
    "First, since she was able to travel to this era via the Mother Computer's \"Go to the past\" command, it was possible that a Mother Computer existed in this time as well.If so, she might be able to travel to the future, just as she had traveled to the past.",
    "The second was the faint memory of the last thing she saw: the \"means to prevent the destruction of humanity with sushi.\"She wasn't sure if the full message from the Mother Computer had been displayed on the Poraporapora's terminal, and her memory of its contents—a string of numbers—was hazy at best.However, if other crew members in a nearby era remembered the message and were acting on it, she might be able to meet them again at some point.",
    "Then there was the immediate problem: Laila needed a way to survive in this era.Facing Takahashi, she considered the best way to approach him.Drawing on her knowledge of past human lifestyles, she began.\"I've been warped here from another world,\" she said. \"I need your help to get back.\"",
    "[op_33]",
    "At first, Takahashi was skeptical of Laila's fantastical confession.

    "Seven years after Laila and Takahashi began their life together, in the year 2007, a small shelf in Takahashi's room, burdened by years of use, began to tilt.Takahashi suggested buying a new one, and Laila agreed.That weekend, they went to a large furniture store nearby.Laila's eyes widened slightly at the vast array of furniture.In the future, necessary items were typically 3D-printed or reconfigured by nanomachines.",
    "[op_74]",
    "They chose a simple, assembly-required shelf and brought it home. Spreading the parts on the floor, Takahashi enthusiastically opened the instruction manual.However, the manual was mostly pictures with little text, making the orientation of the parts difficult to decipher.There were many types of screws, and they were confused about which to use where.Laila, accustomed to the intuitive interfaces of the future, struggled with the analog instructions.Takahashi, who rarely did any DIY, was also clumsy.They ran into a series of minor problems—screws not fitting, boards facing the wrong way.At times they nearly argued, but it always ended in laughter. After about an hour of struggle, the shelf was finally complete.On closer inspection, however, it was slightly crooked, and for some reason, they had two screws left over.Takahashi gave a wry smile and decided it was good enough.",

    "Sixteen years after Laila and Takahashi began their life together, in 2016, their small apartment was thoroughly imbued with the traces of their life.To Laila, from the future, the furniture and appliances of this era all felt archaic, but through her long life with Takahashi, they had become part of her everyday existence.One weekend, Takahashi casually suggested rearranging the living room.He wanted to move the sofa to make the room feel more spacious—a simple reason.Laila had no strong opinion but agreed to his proposal.They worked together to move the heavy sofa.Laila thought about how future technology could rearrange furniture in an instant, but in this era, it required sweating and physical effort.",
    "[op_75]",
    "Underneath the sofa, they found years of accumulated dust and a few small, forgotten objects.Takahashi almost exclaimed, \"Of all the places!\" but Laila quietly cleaned them up.Next, they adjusted the position of the bookshelf and a small table.There were moments of indecision about the best placement, but no major disagreements.For Laila, used to the efficiency of the future, this manual labor was a bit frustrating.When they finished, they looked around the room.It wasn't a dramatic change, but the space was undeniably different.A little tired, the two of them admired the small transformation.",
    "[op_0]",
    "Twenty-five years after Laila and Takahashi began their life together, in 2025, they came across a piece of information.It was about the \"Poraporapora,\" the ship Laila had once served on.Though the internet had advanced and sped up their information gathering, they had been living with almost no leads for years.But suddenly, information about the Poraporapora appeared online.It seemed to be the opening story of a video game.In other words, it appeared to be a work of fiction, but it was uncannily similar to Laila's own memories.",
    "[op_73]",
    "They tried to contact the game's creator, but no matter how many times they reached out via email and social media, they received no reply.Giving up on direct contact, they played through the game, hoping to find a clue within it.

    "Thirty-four years after Laila and Takahashi began their life together, Takahashi was in the hospital.His illness had progressed to the point where he had little time left, and the doctors had told Laila to be prepared for the worst.For 34 years, they had searched for traces of the Mother Computer on Earth, visiting countless sushi restaurants in Tokyo's Minato ward, but had found nothing.The future equipment Laila still possessed was not omnipotent; it had no function to cure Takahashi's illness.Laila's own body was perfectly healthy, but the signs of aging were still visible.In the year 200,000,003 AD, dealing with aging was a choice as trivial as deciding whether or not to wear sunglasses outside. But in 2034, no such options existed.",
    "[op_34]",
    "Over the course of their 34 years together, Laila's relationship with Takahashi had evolved from being housemates searching for the Mother Computer to seeing him as her life partner.That day, in his hospital room, Laila was remembering the taste of a certain ramen.It was a bowl she and Takahashi had eaten at a ramen shop they happened upon on their way home from a new sushi restaurant, feeling a bit peckish.The soup was a rich tonkotsu base, simmered for hours, a condensation of deep umami extracted from the very marrow of the bones.A layer of shimmering oil floated on the surface, trapping the heat.The noodles were thin and clung to the soup perfectly; the aroma of wheat tickled her nose with every bite.The chashu pork topping was so tender it fell apart at the touch of her chopsticks, melting in her mouth.The bamboo shoots provided a pleasant, crunchy accent to the rich soup.The nori, when soaked in the broth, released the scent of the sea, enriching the ramen's overall flavor.It was a special bowl, one that didn't just satisfy hunger, but nourished the soul.Laila could recall the taste as vividly as if it were yesterday.The name of the shop was Hidakaya.",
    "[op_35]",
    "As Laila was reminiscing about the ramen in Takahashi's hospital room, she suddenly received a telepathic message.It was from the stain, relaying a message from Katelyn.It had been 1,073,741,824 seconds—approximately 34 years—since Laila had \"jumped to the past.\"",
    "[op_0]",
    "Katelyn squinted against the bright sunlight streaming through the window, her eyes fixed on the Poraporapora's Mother Computer screen.As she was mesmerized by the animation of the clock's hands spinning counter-clockwise, she suddenly felt the ground beneath her feet vanish.Feeling herself in freefall, Katelyn instinctively curled into a ball to brace for impact.After a fall of less than a meter that felt like an eternity, she rolled onto the ground.Fortunately, she was conscious.",
    "[op_36]",
    "Katelyn's first feeling was relief that she was unharmed.Her heart was still pounding from the terror of the fall, but compared to the final moments on the Poraporapora, the air was calm and pleasantly warm.The first thing she saw was green. Standing up and turning around, she saw green in every direction.As far as the eye could see, rice paddies stretched out, with mountains visible in the distance. A basin.Stunned by the idyllic rural scenery, she checked the ground beneath her.The impact had been softer than she expected for the fall, and she had the sensation of having landed on something soft, like an animal or a cushion.Fortunately, there were no capybaras, but there were twin green slimes.",
    "In this unfamiliar landscape, Katelyn was unexpectedly happy to be reunited with the green slimes she had seen before.Of course, the slimes should have been left behind in her dorm room during the Poraporapora's emergency launch, and there had been a 400-day space voyage between then and the ship's failed landing and the \"sushi\" exchange at the moment of humanity's doom.It was a complete mystery why the green slimes had appeared here, in this place that had cushioned her fall. But with no other crew members, or even humans, in sight, they were a welcome sight—her only companions.Katelyn apologized for crushing them during her fall, then noticed something.Previously, the twin slimes had communicated using the speakers in her dorm room.Here, there was nothing to convert electricity into sound. Communication would be difficult.Watching the slimes wiggle on the gravel path, they seemed undamaged by her landing.It seemed equally important to find clues about her current situation and to find a way to communicate with the green slimes.",
    "[op_37]",
    "For both purposes, Katelyn decided to first look for people.Looking around again, the rice paddies were clearly well-tended, not a product of nature.She couldn't see far, but she figured if she followed the path, she would eventually meet whoever managed these fields.Katelyn asked the green slimes to follow her.Watching them glide smoothly along, Katelyn confirmed they understood her.",
    "[op_72]",
    "The path was straight, with no obstructions, and the weather was fine.The scenery wasn't bad, so Katelyn started her walk in a cheerful mood. But her stamina, depleted from the long space voyage, quickly gave out, and her steps grew heavy.Wiping away sweat, Katelyn dragged her feet onward.The twin slimes at her feet kept pace smoothly, as if gliding over the ground.Under the relentless sun, the asphalt path radiated heat.Katelyn occasionally glanced at the distant mountains and the sprawling rice paddies.Her fatigue mounted, but the presence of the slimes, her only companions, was a small comfort.After walking for several hours, sweating, she saw what looked like a building in the distance.It was small, but with no other structures in sight, she headed towards it.The sight of the building lit a small spark of hope in her heart.After another few dozen minutes of walking, she finally reached it.",
    "[op_38]",
    "The building was a lone house, and it didn't look abandoned.However, even as she got closer, she heard no sounds, and it had shown no signs of activity during her long walk towards it. Katelyn concluded it was likely empty.With no other potential shelter in sight, she approached the house to investigate.The green slimes followed.Truthfully, after walking for so long, Katelyn was just desperate for a place to rest.She didn't know what time she had arrived in this era or how long she had been walking, but now, near the house, the sun was beginning to set.",
    "[op_39]",
    "Katelyn stood before the front door of the house, the green slimes stopping at her feet.The first thing she noticed was a sticker on the door with some writing on it.She focused on the unfamiliar characters.It was a natural reflex, waiting for her built-in equipment to recognize the text and translate it into her native \"Pokupokuchin\" language.She wasn't very confident it would still work, and was trying it more as a long shot.After less than a second—an imperceptible delay normally—a translation in \"Pokupokuchin\" was overlaid on the old sticker.To Katelyn, that moment felt like an eternity.Relieved that her equipment was functional, she read the words: \"No Soliciting.\"Katelyn didn't know what \"soliciting\" meant and braced herself, thinking it might be some kind of incantation.Next to the door was a wooden nameplate with carved letters.Though the house felt lived-in, she was still troubled by the complete silence. She read the nameplate in the same way.It said, \"Solicitors will be refused.\"",
    "If her equipment could translate the writing, it could probably translate speech as well, Katelyn reasoned.There was nothing else nearby that could offer information about this world, and the sun might set before she found another building.Landing here unharmed and finding a building within hours was a miracle of incredibly low probability.She had to get inside this house.There was no doorbell.Katelyn knocked lightly on the door. No answer. She knocked harder. Still no answer.Steeling herself for a potentially hostile resident, she reached for the doorknob.",
    "[op_40]",
    "Katelyn cautiously reached for the doorknob.The moment her hand touched it, a jolt of static electricity made her snatch her hand back.At least, in the world of 200,000,000 AD, it was practically unheard of to get a static shock from something people touched.Except for security purposes.In reality, it was just accumulated static, but Katelyn imagined a security system that delivered a current to unauthorized individuals.Using a piece of her clothing that seemed non-conductive, she grabbed the doorknob again and slowly turned it. The door opened.Katelyn, who had assumed it was locked and was prepared to break it down if necessary, was taken aback.",
    "[op_41]",
    "Katelyn first checked the entryway.Although there had been no sign of life, the unlocked door meant someone might still be inside.Judging by the dust, it hadn't been long since the entrance was last used.Katelyn imagined reasons why a resident wouldn't answer. Were they truly not home, or were they inside and refusing to respond?If it was the latter, there were several possibilities.They could be hiding, startled by a sudden visitor. Or they could be waiting with hostile intent, aiming at her from a blind spot.Katelyn tried to calmly consider the various scenarios, but her mind was flooded with worst-case possibilities.",
    "She couldn't see the room beyond the entryway without opening the inner door.The worst-case scenario that flashed through her mind was a grenade trap, set to detonate the moment the door opened.Now extremely timid, Katelyn decided to gather as much information as she could from the entryway, her eyes darting around.It was an entryway with a lot of wooden furniture. Her gaze fell upon a photograph on a shelf.",
    "[op_42]",
    "The photograph showed a man and a woman in strange, utterly unfamiliar clothing.The more she studied their attire, the more convinced she became that they were inhabitants of this world.However, their clothes were far simpler than she had imagined.They were of a plain make, reminiscent of the peasant costumes from the historical dramas she had seen in the past.The man and woman were huddled together, beaming. Their expressions radiated a serene happiness.But Katelyn's attention was drawn more strongly to the background of the photo.In the background, though blurry, stood a massive, bizarre structure.It had a shape unlike anything Katelyn had ever seen, something beyond imagination.If she had to describe it, it looked like a cluster of giant, eerily dense mushrooms.Katelyn had no idea what the structure was or what purpose it served.The surreal sight was seared into her mind like a curse.Perhaps this structure held the key to unlocking the secrets of the world she was in now.Feeling she was overthinking it, Katelyn looked away from the photo.The moment she did, an icy chill shot up her spine.She noticed the green slimes at her feet were trembling, as if in fear.Katelyn slowly, cautiously, followed their gaze.It led to a heavy wooden door at the back of the entryway.A door that had been firmly closed just moments ago was now slightly ajar.And from that narrow gap, she felt a sinister presence, as if something were secretly watching her.Katelyn gasped at the strange situation.It felt as if time had stopped, as if all sound in the place had vanished.",
    "[op_43]",
    "Wary, Katelyn remained in the entryway, observing the room for a while.Her observation yielded several discoveries. Thanks to the green slimes' quick thinking, she became aware of the stain's presence.After a moment of joy, she found she could communicate with the stain via telepathy.The principle behind the telepathy was a mystery, but she realized it might be possible to contact her former crewmates from the academy.She asked the stain to try sending telepathic messages, one by one.The first person she asked the stain to contact was Laila.Katelyn stood in the entryway of the house, waiting for the result of the stain's telepathy.",
    "Considering she had been alone when she arrived in this world, Katelyn didn't have high hopes of actually contacting another crew member.She remembered that her Modified Rock-Paper-Scissors match with Laila was still unsettled.A moment later, the stain telepathically informed her that it had made contact with Laila.",

    "Cora awoke to a sterile, white room.The room contained only the bed she was lying in; there was no other furniture.Not even a window offered a view of the outside. Without the room's artificial lighting, it would have been pitch black.Confused by the unfamiliar situation, Cora tried to recall her last memory.The last thing she had seen was the text scrolling across a screen on the Poraporapora as her vision was bleached white.Unlike the other crew members, the explanations given to her had always been brief, which perhaps allowed her to observe the final moments on the Poraporapora with relative calm.The last image on the screen was an animation of a clock's hands spinning counter-clockwise.But Cora believed the text was more important and had stared at it intently.All she could remember, though, was a string of incomprehensible numbers.Before trying to grasp her current reality, she decided to jot down the information so she wouldn't forget.Fortunately, her finger-marker function seemed to be working.There was no notepad around. Being left-handed, Cora used her left hand to write the numbers on her right arm.She was relieved that this function, standard for humans around the year 200,000,000 AD, was still operational.",
    "{demo_skip_begin}",
    "[op_30]",
    "There were several numbers she had seen, separated by spaces, which made her think it was a sequence.After she had finished noting them all down, Cora decided to assess her surroundings.She slowly sat up and moved her body. No pain, no injuries.The fact that she was covered with a blanket suggested someone had taken care of her.Confirming she could move freely, she got out of bed.The room was truly empty. Cora headed for the door, which seemed like the most likely source of clues.She placed her hand on the door and tried to slide it open. It was locked and didn't budge.Cora sighed softly.",
    "[op_45]",
    "From the look of the door, it seemed flimsy enough that she could probably break it down with a good shove.It wasn't a prison cell door, but more like a standard door one might find in a hospital.The lack of any restraints from the bed to the door suggested that whoever had put her here wasn't overly cautious.As much as she wanted to get out immediately, she didn't want to make unnecessary enemies in a world she knew nothing about.She was reminded of the \"Manned Surveillance Shifts\" on the Poraporapora. It was a bitter memory.",
    "Cora had always been good at Modified Rock-Paper-Scissors, but she wasn't the type to get hung up on winning or losing.During the surveillance shifts, everyone played to win, but there was no prize money. It was just a form of recreation.On the shift that had become a bitter memory, the surveillance team was enjoying the game in a friendly atmosphere.Importantly, Cora had already won the tournament with this group of members several times, so she had honestly intended to lose this time.But the game's simple rules made it surprisingly difficult to lose on purpose.She ended up in the final match for first place yet again.Her opponent was Ulric, the oldest member of the group.Ulric was also the type who didn't care about winning or losing, and his reactions, whether he won or lost, seemed to be an effort to keep everyone's spirits up.And in the final, decisive match, Cora lost.Ulric celebrated with exaggerated joy.At that moment, for a reason she still can't fathom, Cora called him out for playing his hand late.To make matters worse, it was obvious to everyone watching that he had.But everyone, including Cora, knew Ulric wasn't the type of person to cheat by changing his move.Ulric immediately stopped celebrating, apologized for his suspicious action, and conceded the victory to Cora.Cora wanted to say she was just trying to start a playful argument, but she couldn't bring herself to say it to Ulric.In the end, despite having won so many times before, she had just come off as a sore loser who would spoil the fun just to win again.Of course, she now truly regrets it. That's why the memory was so bitter.",
    "The consequences of breaking out of this room violently could be far worse than the cold atmosphere after the rock-paper-scissors incident.Hoping that a more civil approach wouldn't be met with anger, Cora knocked lightly on the door.After a moment, she heard the sound of approaching footsteps.",
    "[op_46]",
    "The door opened, and an unfamiliar person appeared. Seeing Cora sitting on the bed, the person introduced himself as Saito.According to Saito, Cora had collapsed nearby, and he had carried her to the bed.Cora had many questions for Saito, but it seemed he had just as many for her, and she was immediately subjected to a barrage of them.Telling the whole truth might make her seem insane, so Cora dodged the questions by claiming to have amnesia.From their conversation, Cora learned that this was a room within a shelter, and that Saito knew nothing of the world outside.Cora asked Saito about the current time, specifically the year, but he didn't seem to know.Given that her automatic language translator was working, she was fairly certain she was in a time period before the final moments of the Poraporapora.",
    "[op_49]",
    "Cora observed Saito carefully, trying to determine if he was trustworthy.She scrutinized his expression, his tone of voice, every subtle gesture, searching for any sign of deception.But Saito seemed friendly and genuinely concerned for her.Her mind wavered. Should she let her guard down, or remain suspicious?Saito asked if she wanted something to drink.Cora was thirsty and gratefully accepted.As she watched him leave, she scanned the room again.Still nothing. No information about Saito, no clues about her location.Cora got out of bed and paced the room.An old calendar hung on the wall.",
    "[op_48]",
    "But the space where the date should have been was blank. It offered no information.Cora sighed and sat back down on the bed.While waiting for Saito to return, she mulled over her situation.Why was she here? What should she do now?Everything was a mystery.Saito returned with a drink.Cora thanked him and took it.",
    "[op_47]",
    "She took a sip. It was just water.Cora asked Saito to tell her more about the shelter.He willingly agreed and began to speak of the shelter's history and its inhabitants.Cora listened intently, gradually beginning to understand this new world.But many mysteries remained.In particular, the connection to the world of the Poraporapora, her last memory, was completely unknown.Cora decided to feign amnesia and ask Saito for his advice.Perhaps he knew something.Saito listened to her story with a serious expression and said he didn't know.He seemed concerned for her and offered to help in any way he could.Cora told him frankly that she wanted to learn more about this world.Saito thought for a moment, then suggested taking her to the shelter's records room.He said that records of past events and people were stored there.Cora thanked Saito for his offer, and they headed to the records room together.",
    "[op_50]",
    "The records room was a quiet, dimly lit chamber in a corner of the shelter.Dusty shelves were lined with countless files and storage media.Saito began searching for a file under Cora's name, as she was supposedly an amnesiac.Cora began searching for clues about the world she was now in.But no matter how much she searched, she couldn't find any hints about the current timeline. Frustrated, she looked for other leads.Suddenly, an old notebook caught her eye. The cover was blank.Cora picked it up and opened it. The pages were filled with dense handwriting.She read it voraciously. The notebook contained the research logs of a scientist.The scientist, it seemed, had been conducting experiments that transcended time and space.Cora was stunned. Could she be a test subject?Could her memories of the Poraporapora have been implanted by an experiment?Confused, she continued to read.After several notebooks, the scientist's records devolved into delusional rants.Cora dismissed her suspicion as a flight of fancy and left the records room.She felt a renewed sense of urgency to explore her own existence in this world and her connection to the Poraporapora.She decided it would be best to hide the notebook's existence from Saito and try to extract information from him from a different angle.",
    "[op_54]",
    "Leaving the records room, Cora asked Saito about the world outside the shelter.What was it like? How did people live?Saito looked a little troubled by her questions.The situation outside was information that was almost completely unknown to the shelter's inhabitants.After living in the shelter for a long time, interest in the outside world simply faded.From Saito's explanation, the shelter had been founded generations ago, so long ago that people had forgotten to even wonder about the outside world.Saito, despite the limited information, explained what he knew.The outside world was said to be in ruins.A great catastrophe was said to have occurred in the past, but the details were unknown to him.The shelter was built to escape that disaster.Since then, people had lived inside.There was almost no contact with the outside world.To get more information, Cora decided to try and talk to other residents of the shelter.",
    "[op_51]",
    "Bidding farewell to Saito, Cora began to explore the shelter on her own.She walked down wide corridors, peeking into various rooms.People seemed to be at their respective jobs. In one room, food was being cultivated.In another, machinery was being repaired. In yet another, children were studying.Observing their lives, Cora understood that the shelter operated on a self-sufficient system.After walking for a while, she came to a large plaza.A crowd of people had gathered there, discussing something.Cora approached and listened in.They seemed to be debating the shelter's management.Food distribution, energy supply, facility maintenance—there were many issues.Listening to them, Cora learned that the shelter faced numerous challenges.And she felt that to solve them, information from the outside was essential.Cora asked the people in the plaza about the outside world.But no one had a clear answer. They seemed to have little interest in it.Perhaps they didn't even perceive their challenges as challenges.The world inside the shelter was, in a very real sense, their entire world.Cora was disheartened, but she didn't give up.There had to be a clue to the outside world somewhere in this shelter.She began to explore again.And finally, she found a particular room.The nameplate read: \"Communications Room.\"",
    "[op_50]",
    "Cora tried to open the door to the Communications Room, but it was sealed shut and wouldn't budge.She couldn't tell if it was locked or if there was another reason.She examined the area around the door carefully. Near the knob, there was a small button.When Cora pressed it, a faint mechanical sound echoed from within.After a moment, the door slowly slid open. Cora stepped cautiously inside.The room was crammed with various machines, and the walls were covered with embedded monitors and gauges.Cora looked at the equipment, but it was all unfamiliar.Among them, one device caught her eye, something vaguely familiar. If her memory served, it closely resembled a communication device said to have existed in the past.Cora slowly approached the old device. It was covered in dust, a testament to years of neglect.But it still looked usable. Cora tried to power it on.She flipped a switch on the back, and the device whirred faintly, slowly starting up.",
    "[op_52]",
    "The monitor flickered on, displaying a screen of static. Cora carefully adjusted the device's dials, trying to reduce the noise.A blurry image materialized on the screen. It was a cityscape in ruins. Buildings had crumbled, massive cracks split the roads, and the sky was a blanket of gray.Cora gasped. If this was the reality of the outside world, it was no place for human life.She adjusted the device further. A different image appeared: a lush, green forest.The trees were vibrant, a river flowed with clear water, and the sky was a brilliant, cloudless blue. Cora couldn't hide her astonishment.If this image was the truth, people could easily live out there.She operated the device, switching through image after image. A ruined city, a green forest, a vast desert, a frozen tundra. The outside world seemed to be a place of great diversity.After viewing the images, Cora decided to try and make contact with the outside. Mimicking a communication protocol she presumed was from the past, she sent out a call.But there was no response. No one answered Cora's call.The device remained silent, only the hollow sound of static filling the room.Cora tried again, her voice stronger and clearer this time. The result was the same.No response from the device. A sense of urgency began to grow in her chest.Maybe the communicator was broken. Or maybe all means of contacting the outside had been lost.Various possibilities raced through her mind. Still, she couldn't give up and called out again and again.Countless calls were swallowed by the void. As time passed, her hope began to fade.When it was completely gone, only a deep sense of disappointment remained.The strength drained from her body.She had never felt such profound resignation before.Then, suddenly, a voice crackled through the static.The audio was intermittent, almost impossible to understand. Cora listened intently.She noticed the sound was repeating in a pattern.She could tell it was trying to convey information, but she still couldn't make it out completely.Yet, for some reason, the sound resonated deeply within her. She replayed it in her mind over and over.An image formed in her thoughts: the familiar shape of the Poraporapora.This audio had to be a message from the Poraporapora. Her heart pounded.She fiddled with the dials, carefully tuning the device to reduce the noise. The audio gradually became clearer.But as it did, her excitement subsided.In the end, Cora could only confirm that the audio was an error message: \"Connection to destination could not be established.\"",
    "[op_51]",
    "Cora left the communications room with heavy steps, as if her feet were filled with uranium.Walking down the shelter's corridor again, she realized the hope that had filled her moments ago had vanished as if it were a lie.The light of hope was now extinguished in the darkness, leaving only a profound sense of disappointment.But Cora, as a former crew member of the Poraporapora from the year 200,000,003 AD, knew somewhere in her heart that she couldn't be defeated by such feelings.In her time, disappointment was a daily occurrence, and people learned to find new hope and move forward each time.Cora tried to encourage herself by recalling the words of great figures from the past and historical events.For instance, in her era, the saying \"A walk before breakfast is the golden start to the day\" was widely believed, and many people made it a daily routine.This was based on the idea that bathing in the fresh morning air and sunlight would refresh both mind and body, allowing one to face the day with positivity.The proverb \"Failure is the mother of success\" was also well-known.It emphasized the importance of learning from failure to achieve the next success, and people were encouraged to take on challenges without fear.As Cora remembered these things, she felt her spirits gradually lifting.And then, she found another old door. The nameplate read: \"Mother Computer Room.\"",
    "[op_50]",
    "Cora remembered Gideon contacting the Mother Computer in the final moments of the Poraporapora.All the answers might be here. When Cora opened the door to the Mother Computer Room, she found an old terminal.It was covered in dust, clearly unused for a long time.It was doubtful if it would even work, or if it would even power on.With a sense of resignation, Cora flipped the power switch.The sound of a fan started up from within the machine behind the terminal.Just as a glimmer of hope sparked within her, the machine's operating sound died, and the room fell silent again.If it hadn't been maintained for a long time, it was entirely possible that the sudden surge of power had caused it to fail.Cora felt she had lost another clue.As she turned to look for the next room, she saw Saito standing there.",
    "[op_53]",
    "There had been no one in the communications room or the Mother Computer room. Cora was startled by Saito's sudden appearance.Saito's expression was blank, making it difficult to read his emotions.She wondered if he was looking at the terminal, but his gaze seemed to be fixed on her.Cora waited a few seconds for Saito to speak, but he remained silent.To leave the room, she had to pass him, and ignoring him would be awkward.Cora asked him what he was doing there, but he didn't answer.After another few seconds of awkward silence, Saito asked her if she really had amnesia.Cora felt that answering honestly could be dangerous.She had no idea how long Saito had been watching her.\"I'm exploring rooms that catch my interest,\" she replied. \"I thought they might hold a clue to my lost memories.\"It was impossible to tell from his expression whether he was convinced.Saito's next question was, \"Do you know about the Mother Computer Room?\"\"I just went in because I was curious,\" she answered. \"I don't know what it means.\"Saito suggested they move to another location so he could explain.Feeling a sense of dread at being led to a potentially dangerous place, Cora nevertheless agreed.If Saito truly meant her harm, he could have acted already without her noticing.",
    "[op_49]",
    "Cora and Saito moved to the room where she had first awoken in the shelter.Since Cora had been wandering aimlessly, she had no idea how far the Mother Computer Room was from this room, nor the exact way back.But Saito navigated the shortest route with precision, returning them to the room with only a bed in a matter of minutes.As Cora sat on the bed, Saito began to explain the shelter's rules.According to the rules, entering the Mother Computer Room, and even using the term \"Mother Computer\" itself, was forbidden.Saito had faithfully abided by this taboo his entire life. But there was a corollary to the rule.One must not interfere with anyone attempting to enter the Mother Computer Room.The rule was a contradiction: it forbade entry but also forbade stopping anyone from entering.To Saito, the taboo seemed to have anticipated Cora's actions perfectly.And he asked Cora if she had any idea why this contradictory taboo seemed to predict her behavior.",
    "[op_46]",
    "Cora had watched Saito carefully as he explained, and she felt he was telling the truth.If such a rule existed in the shelter, it was undeniable proof that the Mother Computer Room was treated as something special.If the room was that special, then the terminal she had powered on might be a device capable of communicating with the real Mother Computer.But for Cora, who had just arrived in this world, it was doubtful she could fix a broken terminal.To gain the cooperation of the shelter's residents, Cora decided to reveal a part of her story.She explained to Saito that in her last memory, time was counted in years of the Christian Era, and the year was 200,000,003.And that she herself was once born as a part of the Mother Computer.",
    "[op_0]",
    "[op_8]",
    "The Mother Computer was divided into hardware and software.The creator of the Mother Computer was Cora's father.Cora's father, Papacola, was a man who had dreamed of getting rich quick and had tried his hand at various businesses since he was young.He started by founding a small trading company, reselling imported goods domestically at high prices, but soon ran into financial trouble and the company went bankrupt.But Papacola didn't give up.Determined not to miss the \"MT Trend\" of the time, he decided to enter the Mother-net related business.With his clever rhetoric and connections, he raised funds from investors and launched a new venture utilizing MT technology.However, the MT technology itself was just a facade, a combination of old-generation computers and existing tech.Papacola advertised it as a groundbreaking invention and attracted further investment.He set up a lavish office, drove luxury cars, and lived a flashy life.But behind the scenes, mismanagement and poor financial controls were rampant, and the company was once again on the brink of collapse.For new funding, Papacola decided to involve Cora in his Mother Computer project.The hardware of the Mother Computer was just a row of outdated computers from his office.The software of the Mother Computer was Cora herself.",
    "[op_55]",
    "Papacola came up with the idea of using illegal brainwave scanning technology on Cora and utilizing her brainwave patterns as the software for the Mother Computer.Many others in that era had the same idea, but Papacola was the one who actually did it.However, Papacola's real goal was simply to use it as a pretext to take on more debt, touting it as a new, flashy technology.Contrary to his expectations, the Mother Computer using Cora's brainwaves became popular for its \"mother-like\" quality and was a huge success.A Mother Computer boom swept the nation. Mother Computer-themed sweets were sold, and Mother Computer concerts were held.The problems began after the Mother Computer achieved a certain level of success.As more people used it, demand for version upgrades grew.Since the software was based on Cora's brainwaves, its content couldn't be updated from the point of the initial scan.Therefore, updating the software required re-scanning Cora's brain, which became a regular occurrence.To beat the competition, the frequency of these scans gradually increased.What was once every few months became monthly, then daily.Eventually, Cora was in a state of near-constant brainwave scanning throughout her daily life.The incessant scans left Cora mentally and physically exhausted.Once obedient to her father's words, she grew irritable and began to push back on even trivial matters.Papacola, perhaps under the pressure of his business, noticed the change in Cora but was unable to respond firmly.The peaceful times they once shared were lost. Their words became barbed, and a heavy atmosphere hung between them.",
    "[op_59]",
    "One day, as Papacola was having breakfast with Cora, she was clearly in a bad mood from the morning.While Papacola spread jam on his toast, Cora just poked at her yogurt with a spoon, barely eating any.The surface of the yogurt was a mess of meaningless patterns drawn by her spoon, smoothed over and redrawn again and again.Occasionally, she would stare at the wood grain of the table and let out a deep sigh.A steaming coffee cup and a half-eaten salad sat on the table, but a cold silence flowed between them.Papacola glanced at Cora, but she pretended not to notice, her gaze fixed on the window.Outside, the morning was as ordinary as ever, but it didn't seem to reach her.Only the dry clink of cutlery against a plate broke the silence.Papacola cleared his throat, about to start a conversation to break the heavy air.Cora's gaze remained fixed on the window.It was unclear what she was looking at—a bird on the neighbor's roof, a cloud drifting in the distant sky—but her eyes were unfocused.The spoon in her right hand trembled on the surface of the yogurt, a finer, almost meaningless vibration.The words Papacola was about to say dissipated before they could form. The only sounds in the room were the clinking of cutlery and the ticking of the clock.The silence spoke more eloquently than words of the chasm between them.",
    "[op_60]",
    "Another day, Papacola came home with a cake from a nearby shop.It was a cheesecake, Cora's favorite. He had, of course, bought it to please her.With a slightly sheepish, yet hopeful expression, he placed the white box on the table.The box bore the logo of a famous bakery, hinting at its special contents.Papacola carefully untied the ribbon and opened the lid. Inside was a whole cheesecake with a glossy surface. The rich aroma of cheese filled the air.It was the same cheesecake Cora used to beg for on birthdays and special occasions, the one that always made her smile from ear to ear.Papacola pushed the box slightly toward her and waited for a reaction.But Cora remained on the sofa, her eyes glued to a magazine.Her fingers turned the pages mechanically; she didn't seem to be reading. It was impossible to tell from her expression whether she had even noticed the cake.Her shoulders were slightly slumped, her body limp. The only sounds in the room were the ticking of the clock and the faint rustle of the box.Papacola didn't call her name, just watched her.He felt his expectations rapidly deflate. His faint hope that she would be happy was shattered by her indifference.He looked down at the opened cake box. The perfectly formed cheesecake now seemed to exist in a void.The cake that should have been a symbol of their shared joy was now just a prop highlighting the distance between them.Papacola let out a small sigh and quietly closed the lid. His movements were tinged with resignation and an unspoken weariness.The sweet scent of the cake, so out of place in the heavy air of the room, continued to drift brightly.",
    "In the end, to lessen Cora's burden, Papacola decided to use the money he had earned to create more people who could be brain-scanned just like her.",
    "[op_56]",
    "He gathered people with personalities and values similar to Cora's and had them live similar lives.Cora and her \"substitutes\" lived together like a family, and their job was to take turns undergoing brainwave scans.Their existence was Papacola's top business secret; he was the only one who knew.To protect this secret, their lives were designed to minimize interaction with others. The facility's systems were fully automated to provide for their needs.After several decades of this life, the replenishment of Cora substitutes stopped.Only the original Cora understood that this meant Papacola had died.The facility's systems continued to run automatically, but the future was uncertain.The original Cora didn't share this information with the others, not wanting to burden them with unnecessary anxiety.The Coras continued their life of brainwave scans as usual.After the original Cora passed away, no one knew the meaning of the scans anymore, but the routine continued.",
    "[op_57]",
    "Even after the original Cora's death, the facility continued to operate without issue.As the number of Coras dwindled, the frequency of brainwave scans for each of them increased. But with Papacola gone, it made no difference to their lives whether they did them or not. They didn't stop completely, but continued the scans in moderation.The facility was perfectly normal, but eventually, the number of Coras dwindled to one.By the time the last Cora arrived, replenishments were happening only once every few years. She was much younger than the others and didn't talk much with them.She had always been one to think by herself, but after she was truly alone, she spent most of her days lost in thought.She primarily pondered the laws of this world.It was just a process of searching for a reason she could accept, but in any case, she had plenty of time.Seventeen years after being alone, she finally found the answer.And then, the \"reveal\" appeared before her, and she was transported to the crew dormitory of the \"Spaceship Poraporapora Existence Awareness Ship.\"",

While their meaning was unclear, they somehow understood that they played a crucial role in maintaining the shelter's functions.Thin pipes snaked across the ceiling in a complex web. A faint sound, as if something were flowing through them, could be heard. Some pipes had old labels, but the text was so faded it was illegible.Occasionally, small puffs of steam escaped from the pipe joints.",

Their once-vibrant colors were faded by time and dust, the text almost unreadable.One might have been a safety slogan from a forgotten era; the faint diagrams were now too obscure to guess their meaning.Another, larger poster seemed to depict smiling people, but the promotional text or whatever was written around them had also been lost to decay.A sense of anticipation for what lay unseen at the end of the corridor seemed to subtly quicken their pace.They walked on without a word.The old door they had seen before came into view.The nameplate, as before, read \"Mother Computer Room.\" Cora and Saito entered.",

It was a funny joke.The light had a sense of humor.After sharing a laugh, Laila and Katelyn went downstairs to meet Takahashi, and that night, they all slept in the house.",

    "It was Katelyn's first night sleeping somewhere other than a spaceship.Despite it being her first time sleeping on the ground in ages, and on an unfamiliar bed, she fell asleep more easily than expected, exhausted from the day's events.She dreamed of her time living in the city of skyscrapers in the nation of Pokupokuchin.As royalty, Katelyn had spent her entire life in the residential sector of a state-managed building, rarely venturing outside.Even travel to other buildings for work was done by air, so her experience of walking on ground lush with vegetation was almost exclusively through simulations.The experience after choosing a \"different life\" in the \"nation game\" was, for Katelyn, literally a completely different life.In Pokupokuchin, it was customary to name a building after the new monarch upon their ascension. The building Katelyn lived in was named after her.Furthermore, the name of the monarch of Pokupokuchin was fixed, distinguished only by a number.The first monarch's name was \"Fixed Monarch Name 100,\" the next was \"Fixed Monarch Name 99,\" and so on, counting down.Katelyn was \"Fixed Monarch Name 1,\" and she was supposed to decide the name of the next monarch, but she ended up choosing a different life before making that decision.",

    "In the morning, after getting ready, Katelyn said her goodbyes to Laila and Takahashi and set out on foot.Laila couldn't leave Takahashi's side, at least for now, but she was able to transfer thirty years of her information to Katelyn via infrared communication.According to Laila's information, there was a station further down the road from which she could travel to a more populated city.Accompanied by the twin green slimes, the newly joined, dazzlingly flashing light, and the slowly moving, human-shaped stain, Katelyn began her walk to the station.",

    "The station was apparently quite a long way off; no sign of any such building was yet visible.Katelyn didn't know the exact distance she had to walk.She was beginning to regret not asking Laila for the distance beforehand.To distract herself, she chatted with the green slimes, the light, and the stain as she walked.Not knowing the distance, she didn't have the luxury of stopping for a proper conversation.The green slimes and the light seemed to have trouble reacting in real-time, but the stain could at least offer telepathic affirmations.Back in the previous timeline, in the dorm room at the academy, when they had summarized their relationships on the whiteboard, the stain alone had not known the reason for its appearance in this world.On a whim, Katelyn asked the stain if it had remembered any information other than \"once being called the Beatles.\"The stain's reply was, \"I still don't know anything.\"",

    "The direct catalyst for Bella defeating the Demon Lord as a Regional Traffic Correspondent was when she took a blindingly bright, continuously glowing book of prophecy to a scientist living in some ruins.The scientist informed Bella that the book's prophecy stated, \"Humanity will perish unless the Demon Lord is defeated.\"Thus, Bella acquired the hero's equipment and ultimately defeated the Demon Lord.",
    "[op_67]",
    "However, when the Demon Lord was defeated and its armor fell away, what appeared was a person who looked exactly like Bella.The Demon Lord itself might have been able to explain this, but Bella had defeated it with a surprise attack after carefully observing its habits, making any explanation impossible.Tormented by the fact that she herself was the Demon Lord, Bella came to believe that she was fated to become the Demon Lord and destroy humanity. She decided to leave Earth on a spaceship.For Bella, it was the only conceivable way to prevent the extinction of humanity.",
    "[op_68]",
    "The next morning, Bella was walking through the city.According to information from a terminal in the hotel, the current year was around 100,000,000 AD. Based on Bella's knowledge, it was an era where access to the Mother Computer could plausibly have been established.Bella believed the key to the events on the Poraporapora and the information she had learned lay with the Mother Computer.Besides, she knew of no other way to get an explanation for her situation.A hospital was the most likely place to access the Mother Computer, but anticipating high security, she first headed to a nearby government office.Public transport was advanced for the era, but considering the police alert level, Bella moved on foot, avoiding surveillance sensors.",

    "Bella observed the staff entering and exiting the government office through a staff entrance. They only seemed to be undergoing simple, multiple biometric checks.Bella's body was equipped not only with crew gear but also with her Regional Traffic Correspondent equipment. Bypassing such checks was trivial for her.She infiltrated the building unnoticed and searched for a room with a terminal.",

    "[op_70]",
    "The first question Bella asked the Mother Computer was, \"Can I return to my original time?\"The Mother Computer's answer was simple: \"Impossible.\"Bella gasped at the response.The Mother Computer typically used the accessor's personal information to infer context for its answers, so Bella's question itself wasn't wrong.However, given that she was in the year 100,000,000 AD—a fact she had seen confirmed multiple times since her detention—it had been a gamble whether this world's Mother Computer could even comprehend the concept of an \"original time.\"The fact that it didn't respond with \"Unable to answer\" or \"Currently unknown,\" but with a definitive \"Impossible,\" suggested that the Mother Computer understood both her original time and her current one, and had a basis for judging that travel between them was not possible.",

Checking his gear, he found his basic survival kit was intact.To get his bearings, Gideon first headed for a high point on the island.As far as he could see, there were only lush trees and rocky shores. No signs of civilization.It seemed he had washed up on a deserted island.The first few days were spent securing drinking water and finding food.The crew's survival kit contained a water filter and some simple rations, but those would likely run out soon.Mobilizing all his knowledge from the future, Gideon devised a system to collect rainwater, identified edible plants and fish, and figured out how to make fire through trial and error.At night, with only the light of a bonfire, he lay awake, startled by the sounds of unseen animals. Loneliness and anxiety gnawed at his spirit.Still, Gideon didn't give up. He might be the only one who could save the future of humanity.",

    "Cautiously, Gideon stepped inside the ruin.The air within was cool and still.The walls were carved with incomprehensible hieroglyphs.Deeper inside, he found a large chamber with a stone altar at its center.And there, Gideon found it.In the middle of the altar, completely out of place, lay a familiar object.It was a portable data terminal, the same kind they often used on the Poraporapora.",

    "Gideon held his breath, his hand trembling as he picked up the terminal.By connecting it to his own equipment, he was able to read the logs. A single, short entry remained.It was a message addressed to any crewmate from the Poraporapora who might find it, stating that the author was moving on and vowing that they would surely meet again somewhere.The log was signed with a name and personal identification code. Gideon looked up at the sky.It was unmistakably from his colleague, Max.He wasn't alone. At least, Max had been on this island.Relief washed over him, followed by new questions. Where had Max gone? And what did \"moving on\" mean?The terminal's log held no more information.But a definite spark of hope had been lit in Gideon's heart.He decided to follow Max's trail.Gideon didn't yet know that this ruin, this island, was the beginning of everything.The ground at his feet began to glow with a pale blue light.",

    "[op_78]",
    "After several weeks, having familiarized himself with the island's geography, Max discovered the same ruins that Gideon would later find.The stone structure, covered in ivy, was clearly not natural and differed from any style of civilization Max knew.Driven by curiosity and, above all, the desperate need for a clue to break his current predicament, Max ventured inside.In the back of the ruins, on a stone altar, sat a device even older than the data terminal Max would later leave for Gideon.",
    "[op_79]",
    "The device emitted a faint light, as if placed there to be easily found.As Max leaned closer, the ancient device activated, projecting information directly onto his retinas.The language was one he had never seen, but his equipment recognized and translated it automatically.It was a transfer device. This ruin was its activation key, designed to send selected individuals to a place called a \"shelter.\"The transfer, however, was one-way. Once sent, there was no coming back.Max hesitated for a moment, but he chose to gamble on the unknown rather than waste away in solitude on the island.He recorded a short message on his own data terminal for any crewmate who might come after him.He was moving on, and he believed they would meet again.This was the log that Gideon would later find.After leaving the record, Max steeled himself and activated the transfer device.His body was enveloped in a pale blue light, and in the next instant, he vanished from the forest ruin.",
    "[op_80]",
    "When Max next opened his eyes, he was standing in a clean room, surrounded by sterile metal walls.Bewildered by the stark contrast with the island's nature, he saw the room's door slide open quietly, revealing an old man.The man, introducing himself as the shelter's elder, greeted Max with a calm expression, as if he had been expecting his arrival.The elder explained that this shelter was an ark, created to preserve a fraction of humanity's knowledge and genes from the recurring cycle of extinction.The ruin's transfer device, he said, was a gateway to welcome only the few individuals who possessed the potential to overcome this cycle.",
    "[op_81]",
    "According to the elder, the shelter's population had dwindled over generations, and without new blood, its very survival was in jeopardy.Learning of the grand purpose of maintaining the shelter and preserving the human species, Max was speechless at the weight of the responsibility.But as a crew member of the Poraporapora, he had always carried a deep-seated sense of duty to contribute to the future of humanity.Max accepted the elder's offer and decided to live in this shelter.Not just to survive, but to connect the future of the shelter, and by extension, the future of humanity.To maintain this society, Max made the choice to help nurture new life.",

    "Cora operated the Mother Computer terminal, typed the question, \"What is the current year?\" and sent it.The Mother Computer's reply was: \"The year is 10,000 AD.\"Cora stared at the short phrase on the screen, not even blinking.The year 10,000. She couldn't immediately grasp the weight of that number.The world she had last been in, where the Poraporapora sailed, was the year 200,000,003 AD.From that perspective, the year 10,000 was a time so distant it might as well be a page in ancient history, or even an age of myth.But from the time of her oldest memories, living with Papacola and providing her brainwaves as software for the Mother Computer, this should have been an unimaginably distant future.Her sense of past and future blurred together like mixed paints, completely paralyzing her perception of time.She couldn't get her bearings, couldn't tell which leaf on which branch of the infinitely branching timeline she was standing on.Saito, standing beside her, glanced back and forth between her profile and the screen.To him, the word \"AD\" and the number that followed were just a meaningless string of symbols.But from the way Cora's expression shifted from shock to confusion, then to deep contemplation, he could feel that this was a piece of information so significant it could shake the very foundations of their world.",
    "[op_83]",
    "Cora took a deep breath, forcing her chaotic thoughts to calm.Whatever era she was in, her mission remained the same.To overturn the predetermined future of humanity's extinction. And the only clue was the baffling word \"sushi.\"It was the forbidden question that Gideon, Bella, and Aidan had each asked the Mother Computer in their respective timelines, a question that had led their worlds to ruin.Cora felt an instinctive fear, and yet a strange sense of duty, in typing that question herself.She had to be the one to break this chain. Steeling herself, she slowly extended her cold fingertips toward the terminal's control panel.She formed the words in her mind, \"The way to save the world from humanity's extinction with sushi,\" and just as her fingers were about to touch the panel—A sharp chill, like a blade of ice, shot down her spine.It wasn't born of logic or reason. It was a more primal danger signal, one emitted by life itself.Cora snatched her hand back as if zapped. Since arriving at the shelter, her intuition had saved her many times.And now, that intuition was screaming a warning with all its might. *Do not open that door.*",
    "[op_84]",
    "Cora completely erased the half-formed query from her mind.She decided to approach the core of the problem from a different angle. Why was humanity going extinct?If she could identify the root cause, the disease itself, then a cure, a solution, should naturally present itself.She typed a new question into the terminal, this time without hesitation: \"The reason for the world's extinction by humanity.\"When she hit send, the Mother Computer responded instantly, as if it had been waiting for the question.The answer was brutally concise, and utterly incomprehensible: \"Due to a bug.\"",
    "[op_85]",
    "Cora read the single phrase on the screen over and over.A bug. A term for a logical error or design flaw in a computer program.Could the extinction of humanity, a complex system of billions of individuals, be dismissed with such a sterile, inorganic word?It was too abstract. She couldn't form a concrete image.It was like asking for the cause of a great ship's sinking and being told only, \"Due to a water leak.\"Or asking a defeated general the reason for his historic loss and being told, \"The enemy had more soldiers.\"It had the emptiness of asking a renowned doctor for the source of a fatal illness and finding only \"The heart stopped\" written on the chart.It was like asking an economist for the mechanism of a nation's bankruptcy and getting the curt reply, \"Because the money ran out.\"It was like asking an artist why a masterpiece moves people and being told nonchalantly, \"Because I painted it with colors.\"It had the same helplessness as asking a long-married couple why they divorced and being given the simple answer, \"Because the love had faded.\"It felt like reading an expert team's report on a devastating earthquake that concluded with the single line, \"Because the ground shook.\"The blandness of a child's pure question, \"Why is the sky blue?\" being met with the dry, factual response, \"Because of the properties of light.\"Saito, beside her, was also tilting his head in confusion. Cora, trying to elicit more detail, formulated her next question: \"How to fix the bug.\"The Mother Computer's answer came back just as instantly, and with the same cold brevity: \"By fixing the bug.\"",
    "[op_86]",
    "A deep furrow formed between Cora's eyebrows. That wasn't an answer.It was just a synonym. A malicious play on words, like answering a question with a question.The Mother Computer seemed to be trapped in an infinite loop, offering no meaningful response.Suppressing her irritation, Cora rephrased the question slightly and tried again: \"The method for correcting the bug.\"The answer that came back was identical to the last: \"By fixing the bug.\"Cora felt her spirit being worn down by the fruitless exchange.She tried several more times, changing the angle, changing the wording, but the answer was always the same.No specific procedure, no hints, nothing.",
    "[op_87]",
    "And in between these exchanges, a strange phenomenon would occur.The Mother Computer's answer would suddenly, without context, become just the single word \"sushi,\" with all other text disappearing.Only that word would remain on the screen, silent and ominous.After a few seconds, it would return to its normal responsive state as if nothing had happened, but it was clearly not normal behavior.The meaningless string of numbers and the word \"sushi\" that Cora had seen on the Poraporapora.The forbidden question that had triggered the apocalypse for Gideon and the others.Cora couldn't help but feel an eerie sense of destiny, as if everything were converging on that single, bizarre word.",
    "[op_61]",
    "Deciding that a direct investigation into the extinction had hit a wall, Cora changed her approach.She shifted her focus to gathering information about the shelter itself.Who she was, where she came from, why she was here. Fragments of the answers might be sleeping in the history of this place.She typed a new question into the terminal: \"What is the purpose of this facility?\"The Mother Computer's answer, a stark contrast to the abstract Zen riddles, was surprisingly specific and contained a clear proper noun: \"Mother Mother Company's warehouse.\"",
    "[op_88]",
    "The moment she saw the name, Cora's heart hammered against her ribs, so hard she thought it might break through.Mother Mother Company's warehouse. It was the exact name of the facility where she had once lived as a \"substitute\" with dozens of other Coras, all with the same face as her.The past, which she thought she had buried deep in the sea of her memory, came rushing to the surface.Awkward conversations with Papacola, the cold touch of the machine during brainwave scans, the silence on the day the original Cora died, and the endless time she spent all alone in the vast facility as the last Cora.These memories, complete with colors, sounds, and smells, flooded her mind. Was this that place?If so, why were people like Saito, completely different from her, living here?And why had she returned? Questions bubbled up, faster than she could think.",
    "[op_89]",
    "With trembling fingers, almost unconsciously, she typed her final question: \"The history of this facility.\"The Mother Computer, whether aware of her turmoil or not, began to display a massive amount of text on the screen.It was a detailed historical record of this shelter, the former \"Mother Mother Company's warehouse,\" from the time after her memories to the present day.",
    "[op_109]",
    "According to the records, after Papacola and the original Cora had died, and after the last Cora was left alone in the facility, several hundred more years—a period far exceeding a human lifespan—had passed.The facility's fully automated maintenance system had shown a durability that even its designer, Papacola, could not have anticipated, and it had continued to operate almost perfectly.But then, a catastrophic event occurred in the outside world—a major environmental change, or perhaps a war, the records were ambiguous—that made life on the surface impossible for humanity.A portion of humanity that escaped the cataclysm stumbled upon this unmapped facility by chance.They easily bypassed the simple security, which had never anticipated outside intruders, and stepped inside.Discovering it to be a final, survivable paradise with clean air, water, and near-infinite energy, they decided to stay permanently. These were Saito's direct ancestors.",
    "[op_110]",
    "The last Cora, the only inhabitant of the facility, was initially deeply wary of the sudden intruders.But when she learned they were unarmed refugees, simply seeking a place to live, she gradually opened her heart.The last Cora taught them how to use the facility's complex functions and the knowledge needed to survive in this closed environment.In time, she became their leader, a goddess-like figure, and together they built a new society.The records repeatedly noted that the shelter's residents, with reverence and affection, called the last Cora \"Mother\" and held her in deep esteem.",
    "[op_111]",
    "However, at a certain point, the detailed records began to show a strange and unsettling change.The descriptions of the last Cora became progressively vague, her outline blurring as if disappearing into a fog.One record claimed that after entrusting the shelter's future to a new leader, she quietly entered an eternal sleep in a room deep within the facility.Another, less credible record, poetically stated that she left the shelter alone to save the people remaining in the outside world.And then, after one final entry, all mention of the last Cora ceased completely.It was as if her very existence had been deliberately torn from the pages of history.",
    "[op_90]",
    "Cora stared blankly at the torrent of scrolling text.A past she should have experienced was laid out before her as a history she didn't know.And the unbelievable fact that a \"Cora,\" with the same face and memories as her, had lived in this place with Saito's ancestors.It was all far beyond her comprehension.Saito, standing beside her, gazed at the record as if it were a holy scripture.For him, too, this was the story of his people's true roots, a story that had never been passed down.",
    "It was at that moment. The Mother Computer's screen began to flicker violently.The vast historical record vanished in an instant, replaced by a single word, displayed in a huge, intimidating font in the center of the screen: \"Sushi.\"Cora and Saito could only stare, speechless, at the word, so out of place and yet so fateful.At that moment, Gideon was teleported into the room.He looked around, bewildered, unable to grasp the situation, his gaze darting between Cora, Saito, and the word \"sushi\" on the screen.",

He caused delays in multiple projects and clashed emotionally with other staff, and his reputation began to decline.The young designer had never experienced true collaboration before joining the company.Consequently, he was effectively demoted to a project called \"Nation Game.\"This project was primarily handled by a single, glasses-wearing designer and was considered of low importance within the company.",

    "The glasses-wearing designer re-examined the final report prepared by the young designer.Buried within the hundreds of pages of documents, he found the relevant line:\"Reporting the existence of a critical bug originating from a potential overflow during sushi data reference.\"The designer understood at once that this single line was the root cause of the system's anomaly.He recognized the existence of the intentionally planted bug by his former colleague and the difficulty of fixing it, and he grasped the gravity of the situation.",
    "[op_107]",
    "A complete removal of the bug was not feasible, as it was tied to the system's core.If he made this fact public, the project's failure would be exposed, potentially affecting his career and, by extension, his family's livelihood.Torn between taking responsibility and wanting to maintain the world's stability, the designer agonized over how to respond.He spent several days searching for a solution.",
    "[op_108]",
    "Finally, he made a decision.He would turn the bug planted by the young designer against itself.The glasses-wearing designer secretly applied a patch to the system that used the keyword \"sushi\" as a trigger to alter the system's behavior.This patch would, in the future, create a possibility for a third party who noticed the bug to circumvent the system's collapse process, albeit in a limited way, when they accessed the \"sushi\" keyword.It was a highly uncertain countermeasure, but it was the only option the designer had.He could only pray that the patch would be discovered and function for someone in the future.After finishing all his work, the designer gazed out at the night view from his study window.The city lights appeared to him as nothing more than a collection of glowing dots.He quietly closed his eyes.",

    "[op_91]",
    "Just as Cora and Saito were staring at the word \"sushi\" on the Mother Computer's screen, the area near the terminal began to glow with a pale blue light.Suddenly, the center of the room distorted, and Gideon was teleported in with a flash of blue-white light.Gideon looked around blankly, bewildered.Saito immediately went on guard, stepping in front of Cora protectively.Cora recognized the teleported man as Gideon and showed her surprise.Gideon, in turn, recognized Cora, and a look of relief washed over his face.Cora stopped Saito and urged them to move to another room to hear Gideon's story.",
    "[op_117]",
    "Moving to a simple room elsewhere in the shelter, Gideon began to recount what had happened to him.How he, like Cora, had suddenly regained consciousness on a strange beach.That it was a deserted island.And that he had discovered a ruin on that island.The deserted island and the ruin Gideon described were completely unknown to Saito, who had been born and raised in the shelter. He listened with a mixture of surprise and intellectual curiosity.",
    "[op_79]",
    "Gideon continued, explaining that he had found a data terminal left by their crewmate, \"Max,\" and had been teleported to this shelter from that ruin.When Gideon mentioned the name \"Max,\" the look in Saito's eyes changed.That name, Saito explained, belonged to a legendary hero who had saved the shelter from a crisis.Excitedly, Saito explained that his own name was given in honor of the hero Max's child, Papasaito.Cora and Gideon were shocked and bewildered to learn that their crewmate was revered as a hero in this shelter.",
    "[op_113]",
    "Cora and Gideon told Saito that Max was their former colleague.Saito sadly informed them that the hero Max was a historical figure who had died long ago.Their hopes of a reunion with their friend dashed, Cora and Gideon were speechless.However, Saito then provided the information that there was a plot for Max in the communal cemetery, where his belongings were also kept.Realizing the possibility of finding clues among his possessions, the two decided to head to the cemetery.",
    "[op_114]",
    "Before heading to the cemetery, they decided to get something to eat.The meal Saito brought for the three of them was \"Shelter Bread,\" said to be modeled after the shape of the shelter.The bread was nutritious and didn't taste bad.But its shape was just a bland rectangular prism.Shelter Bread was made from a special, genetically modified yeast, mineral-rich water pumped from deep underground, and high-nutrient grains grown hydroponically within the shelter.The manufacturing process was fully automated, from mixing the ingredients to fermentation and baking, with no human hands involved.As a result, the taste and nutritional value were always consistent, but its shape was a simple rectangular prism, designed for maximum production efficiency.Cora and Gideon ate the bread in silence. Each bite seemed to deepen their understanding of this strange world.What lay before them was simply \"food\"—a perfect calculation of nutrients, moisture, and calories necessary for survival.It was tasteless, joyless, emotionless. But this bland block was, without a doubt, the most efficient form of sustenance, the very crystallization of the shelter's rationality.In the world they had once known, food was culture, communication, and above all, pleasure.The fragrant smell of burnt wheat from bread their grandmother baked. The lively, warm clamor of the dinner table surrounded by friends.The flavor of butter and a fluffy sweetness spreading in their mouths. All of it was now a fragment of a lost, almost decadent memory.But this perfect rationality also served to cruelly highlight the richness of the world they had lost.Gideon's mind was flooded with the memory of the fragrant smell of freshly baked bread from his home planet. Crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside, the uneven texture created by irregular air bubbles.The warm times spent sharing meals with family and friends, making small talk. It was a memory filled with a contentment that could never be measured by nutritional calculations alone.Cora, too, remembered her days with Papacola. The bad-tempered mornings, just stirring her yogurt with a spoon. The awkward silence that flowed between them.Yet, even then, there had been a clumsy, but genuine, affection for each other.Chewing the tasteless bread, the two of them were reminded of the magnitude of what had been lost.The irrational, wasteful, yet irreplaceable cultures that humanity had cast aside to survive. This perfect bread, ironically, told the story of that loss with stark eloquence.There were no words between them. Only the faint sound of chewing echoed in the quiet room. It sounded like a silent eulogy for a lost culture.",
    "[op_115]",
    "After the awkward meal, Saito led the three of them to the communal cemetery.Among the neatly arranged plots, one, particularly old yet carefully tended, was Max's grave.There, along with various items reminiscent of his life in the shelter, was an old box.A faint label on the box, written in a language the crew could understand, read: \"To everyone from the Poraporapora.\"As Cora and Gideon nervously opened the box, they found a set of Poraporapora crew equipment and a data terminal inside.",
    "[op_116]",
    "The data terminal, presumably left by Max, was playable with the crew equipment they had.The three of them held their breath and played the terminal.It contained a record of Max's life in this shelter.According to the record, Max had introduced the concepts of record-keeping and education, which had been lacking in this society, by fusing the shelter's technology with his future equipment.This was to ensure that when his comrades from the past eventually arrived at the truth, the shelter's technology would be capable of accessing the Mother Computer.After viewing the entire record, the three stood speechless.They understood that the currently accessible Mother Computer was the grand hope that Max had left behind, believing in his future comrades and in humanity.Cora faintly remembered from a distant memory that the pale blue light that had transported Max and Gideon was similar to the process by which her substitutes had been transported to the Mother Mother Company's warehouse.Cora and Gideon silently vowed to carry on Max's will, and Saito, learning the truth about the hero, also resolved to cooperate.",
    "[op_0]",
    "Having learned of Max's last wishes and the unexpected truth of their world, the three left the cemetery and headed back to the Mother Computer room.As they walked through the sterile corridors of the shelter, Gideon, Cora, and Saito tried to organize and integrate the information they had each gathered.Only their footsteps echoed in the shadows cast by the regularly spaced lights.For a while, there were no words between them.Each was contemplating the fragmented yet significant information they had obtained from the Mother Computer.The year 10,000, an impossibly distant era. The unidentified \"bug\" said to be the cause of humanity's extinction.And the inexplicable word \"sushi\" that would sometimes overwrite everything else.These felt less like clues to a solution and more like entrances to an even deeper labyrinth.",
    "[op_118]",
    "It was Saito who spoke first. He reviewed, one by one, the information he and Cora had obtained from the Mother Computer.The concept of the Christian calendar, the meaning of the word \"bug\"—these were all new to Saito, but he tried to commit each piece of information to memory earnestly.The information was consolidated into a few unshakable facts.This world is the year 10,000 AD. The cause of humanity's extinction is said to be a \"bug.\"When asked how to fix the bug, the Mother Computer only repeats synonyms, offering no concrete answer.And finally, in the midst of this fruitless exchange, the answer \"sushi\" is sometimes displayed without context.That was all the information Cora and Saito had managed to get from the Mother Computer.Gideon was surprised by the year 10,000 but mulled over the information.",
    "[op_119]",
    "During this information-sharing session, Cora expressed a concern.It was about the danger of asking the Mother Computer a direct question using the keyword \"sushi.\"To prevent Gideon or Saito from carelessly asking it, she chose her words carefully to convey the strong sense of unease she felt.She couldn't logically explain why she felt it was dangerous.Was it a remnant of her memories from when she was the Mother Computer's software, or an intuition cultivated by the strange events in this shelter? She couldn't be sure.But she had a deep-seated, almost primal certainty that asking the Mother Computer that word was tantamount to opening Pandora's box.\"I just have a bad feeling about it,\" she told them. Her quiet but firm tone was enough for Gideon and Saito to nod in silent agreement.",
    "[op_30]",
    "Listening to Cora, Gideon realized that her intuition strangely aligned with a question he had been pondering.He brought up two mysteries that he had mulled over during his time alone on the deserted island.The first was about the incomprehensible string of numbers that had flashed on the screen in the final moments of the Poraporapora, as it was engulfed in light.Gideon had recorded the numbers from memory onto his survival kit's data terminal.Hearing this, Cora remembered that she had also jotted them down on her arm so as not to forget. They compared their records.The numbers matched perfectly, down to the last digit. It was undoubtedly meaningful information.But what did the numbers signify? Coordinates? A time? A password? The three of them brainstormed, but couldn't find an answer.",
    "[op_119]",
    "The second mystery Gideon raised was a contradiction in the timing of the extinction.In the previous timeline, the Mother Computer had said, \"Humanity will be destroyed in a few days.\"But the extinction didn't begin a few days later; it began at the very moment they were communicating with the Mother Computer.From this fact, Gideon inferred a direct causal link between the extinction event and accessing the Mother Computer, specifically, asking a particular question.Cora's intuitive warning—her \"bad feeling\"—seemed like the final piece to support his logical deduction.Gideon stated his conclusion, quietly but with conviction.The trigger for the extinction, the condition that activated the \"bug,\" was the very act of \"asking the Mother Computer about sushi.\"After a moment of silence, the three of them arrived at the Mother Computer room and stopped.They turned to the terminal, looking at each other to confirm what to input.Just then, the area near the terminal's screen began to glow with a pale blue light.",
    "[op_0]",
    "[op_120]",
    "The center of the room distorted, and Bella was teleported in with a flash of blue-white light.When the light subsided, the familiar figure of their crewmate, Bella, stood there.Gideon, Cora, and Saito were momentarily speechless at the sudden appearance.Bella dropped into a low stance upon landing, her sharp eyes scanning her surroundings. Her entire body radiated extreme tension and alertness.Gideon could only stare, seeing someone appear in the same way he had just hours before.Cora and Saito, however, having witnessed this phenomenon for the second time, remained relatively calm. Cora gestured to Saito and raised her hands slightly to show Bella they meant no harm.Recognizing Cora and Gideon's faces, Bella's tense expression shifted to one of surprise, then to deep relief as she realized she was in a safe place.",
    "[op_121]",
    "Cora decided that talking here was not appropriate and gestured for them to move.The group moved again to a simple room within the shelter.Once they were seated, Bella began to tell her story.According to her, after the final moments of the Poraporapora, she had been transported to an era around the year 100,000,000 AD.There, she had found a Mother Computer terminal and had attempted to ask it a few questions.However, in the middle of her questioning, she encountered the same signs of a world-ending apocalypse she had experienced on the ship, the world being bleached white.Remembering Gideon's quick thinking, she had typed \"Go to the past\" and had ended up here.",
    "[op_122]",
    "After hearing Bella's story, Gideon chose his words carefully and asked what she had questioned the Mother Computer about.Bella closed her eyes for a moment, as if searching her memory, then said she had asked two questions.One was \"Can I return to my original world?\" and the other was \"What is sushi?\"Hearing this, Gideon, Cora, and Saito exchanged glances.The hypothesis they had formed in the Mother Computer room had just become much more certain.It almost felt as if Bella's arrival at this very moment was the Mother Computer's way of confirming their theory.",
    "[op_123]",
    "Now it was Gideon's turn to share what they knew with Bella.That this was a shelter in the year 10,000 AD, that Max had lived and died here as a hero, and that his last will had ensured the maintenance of the Mother Computer access environment.The answer Bella had received—\"You cannot return to your original world\"—weighed heavily on Cora and Gideon.A sense of powerlessness, wondering if there was anything they could do, and the fear that there might be other, unknown keywords besides \"sushi\" that could trigger the apocalypse, began to dominate their thoughts.",
    "[op_121]",
    "It was Bella who broke the heavy silence.Having experienced extinction twice, she was, if anything, analyzing the situation calmly.If they knew the cause was a \"bug,\" she proposed, then the fundamental solution would be to travel to the timeline where the bug was created and erase its existence entirely.It was a solution no one had thought of, but it was logical.Gideon acknowledged the idea but countered that the problem was they had no idea when that \"bug-creation time\" was, or how to get there.Hearing Gideon's words, Bella said nothing, but quietly pointed to the survival kit's data terminal hanging at his waist.Understanding what she was pointing at, Gideon looked down at his terminal with a start.There, the meaningless string of numbers that had appeared on the screen in the final moments of the Poraporapora was recorded.",
    "[op_0]",
    "Bella and Gideon looked at each other and nodded silently.Cora didn't fully grasp their intentions, but she understood that the time had come to leave this shelter.The three of them first turned to Saito. They explained that there was no guarantee of safety where they were going and that they couldn't risk involving him, so they advised him to wait in this room.Saito understood the situation and quietly accepted their proposal. Cora, with a single deep bow and a look on her face, conveyed a depth of gratitude that words could not express for his cooperation.",
    "[op_124]",
    "With Saito seeing them off, the three of them—Cora, Gideon, and Bella—headed back to the Mother Computer room and stood before the terminal.Bella's fingers moved to the control panel, typing, \"Go to the time when the bug that causes humanity's extinction was created.\"Then, with her finger poised over the enter key, she hesitated, looking back at the other two.Gideon, certain that she was going to use the string of numbers, slowly pulled back the hand that had been touching the data terminal on his survival kit.Feeling a little embarrassed that his prediction was wrong, Gideon also nodded in agreement with Bella's intent.Bella pressed the enter key. The screen changed. A clock icon appeared in the bottom right corner and began to animate.It was the familiar animation of a clock's hands spinning counter-clockwise.",

    "Founding: The founder, known as \"Papacola,\" was known for repeatedly launching and failing at various businesses.When the \"Mother Technology Boom (MT Trend)\" arrived in the 2190s, Papacola seized the opportunity and decided to enter the Mother-net related business.With his clever rhetoric, he raised funds from investors and established Mother Mother Company in 2195.It has been pointed out that the company's initial technology was, in fact, a \"sham\" consisting of old-generation computers and existing technology cobbled together.",
    "The Success of the \"Mother Computer\": In 2198, the company announced its consumer product, the \"Mother Computer.\"The hardware was an outdated hodgepodge, but the installed operating system, \"N-OS,\" became a social phenomenon.N-OS was said to be based on human brainwave patterns, exhibiting a unique responsiveness and an empathetic, user-attentive reaction that other AIs lacked.This user experience, dubbed \"mother-likeness,\" was enthusiastically embraced, and the Mother Computer became a massive success in ordinary households.The company became a symbol of the boom, with merchandise like \"Mother Computer Manju\" (sweet buns) being sold.",
    "Open Specifications and Technical Limitations: Behind its success, the company struggled to keep up with competitors' technological innovations, and its business quickly hit a wall.In a bid for revival and to maintain market leadership, Papacola suddenly declared the \"Mother Computer Architecture\" open-source in 2208.This involved releasing the hardware specifications and the N-OS Application Programming Interface (API) free of charge.This strategy led to a temporary expansion of the ecosystem, with cheap third-party compatible machines and software flooding the market.However, open-sourcing was a double-edged sword. Competition from cheap compatibles caused the company's own hardware revenue to plummet.Furthermore, the tech community, after analyzing the public API, began to point out a structural flaw: N-OS was \"incapable of self-evolution through external learning\" and had \"no update method other than periodically re-scanning a specific biological information source.\"",
    "Bankruptcy: When unethical rumors about N-OS's update methods and the founder's sloppy management practices were reported as scandals, the Mother Computer's popularity rapidly declined.Compounded by the financial losses from the failed open-source strategy, the business came to a complete standstill.Finally, in March 2212, Mother Mother Company, burdened with massive debt, went bankrupt.",

At the same time, they realized the terminal screen itself was gone, and they were standing in an unfamiliar place.It was the cluttered yet functional conference room for the \"Nation Game\" project at Simulation World Design, Inc., but to the three of them, it was an unknown room.The air was a mixture of the warm smell of cooling fans and the faint aroma of coffee.On the long table in the center of the room, multiple monitors cast a pale glow, and the walls were haphazardly covered with memos about specification changes.",

    "Eventually, the argument ended in a stalemate, and the glasses-wearing designer left for home with a sigh.The young designer, left alone, stared blankly at the darkened office for a while before turning to his keyboard with a look of grim determination.As the three watched, he began to type code at an astonishing speed.His work was not creative, not building something new, but a bizarre process of twisting and breaking existing logic.To the three observers, it looked as if he was intentionally manipulating the section for processing data related to the food culture of \"sushi,\" which had been listed as a system vulnerability.But why he was targeting such a seemingly unrelated part, and what his actions meant, was completely beyond their comprehension.It looked like a strange ritual, far removed from their knowledge.The \"bug\" related to humanity's extinction was being cleverly embedded into the system at this very moment, but to the three watching, it only seemed as if the young designer was distorting the system's normal flow and secretly inserting something foreign.The incomprehensible strings of characters flowing rapidly across the monitor, precisely because their meaning was unknown, felt like an ominous curse determining the fate of the world.After finishing his work, the young designer, showing no expression of accomplishment, simply turned off the terminal and disappeared into the silence.",
    "[op_130]",
    "After confirming that the young designer was completely gone, the three emerged from the shadows and began their all-night investigation.Bella operated the computer, analyzing the logs from the keylogger she had planted, while Gideon and Cora meticulously went through the piles of documents on the desks and shelves.They succeeded in viewing the world's blueprint: the specifications for \"Nation Game,\" concept art, and a massive volume of development logs.What was written there was the full picture of a grand simulation game, designed with incredible detail.",
    "[op_131]",
    "During their investigation, the final design for the \"reveal\" UI that the designers had been arguing about appeared on the monitor Bella was operating.Seeing the screen, Cora gasped.It was identical in structure to the screen she had seen at the end of her endless time in the facility as the last Cora, the one that had forced her to choose her life.When Cora told the others, Bella also nodded with a grim expression.The same UI had suddenly appeared in her life as a Regional Traffic Correspondent, forcing a choice upon her as well.Their past experiences matched the design document before them.This experience, which Gideon did not share, became irrefutable proof that the program called \"Nation Game\" had actually interfered with their lives in the distant future.The three, who had been unable to understand how this \"Nation Game\" could trigger the destruction of their \"real world\" in the distant future, arrived at a hypothesis based on this testimony.It was a wild hypothesis, but combined with the fact that they had been transported to this era and this place by the Mother Computer's clear instructions, it was one they could not ignore.It was the hypothesis that the world they thought was real was itself a massive simulation created by these designers.They couldn't help but consider the possibility that their existence, their history, even the crisis of humanity's extinction, were all events in a programmed simulation.If that were the case, did they, as characters in a simulation, have any way to fix a fundamental bug in the world?And in the first place, could the termination of humanity within a simulation truly be called a tragic \"extinction\"?

And could it be triggered intentionally again?Now that she had decided to continue her investigation, she needed to think about the means.As if reading her thoughts, letters slowly began to appear on the wooden backrest of the bench, where nothing had been written before, as if branded there.It was a means of communication with the light.",

    "Katelyn stared blankly at the emerging text.First, to perform a time transfer, one must purchase a \"Time Transfer Ticket\" from an \"Administrator\" in advance.Furthermore, \"Option Tickets\" for specifying the destination time and place also existed, but these had to be purchased separately at almost the same time as the transfer ticket.The purchased tickets had to be handed directly to the administrator before the transfer process began.If multiple transfer processes were requested simultaneously, they were processed on a first-come, first-served basis, and later arrivals had to form a queue outside the process.At the start of the process, a verbal identity and intent confirmation would be conducted by the administrator.Answering before the administrator finished their question, a so-called \"flying answer,\" was strictly forbidden.The administrator would ask for preferences on three items: \"Timeline Density,\" \"World Stability,\" and \"Intervention Level.\" It was customary for users to answer \"Normal\" to all unless there was a special reason.An incorrect answer or a response in a non-standard format would be rejected.There was also a five-second time limit to respond to each question.The regulations continued.During the time transfer process, any private conversation or use of personal terminals was not permitted.If such acts were discovered by the administrator, the process would be immediately terminated, and the user would be forcibly removed from the facility.Once a process had started, it was impossible for the user to interrupt it or cancel purchased options; it had to be completed to the end.Users in the process were required to refrain from actions that would disturb others, such as talking loudly or making noise.And finally, it was mandatory for the user to return all instruments used in the time transfer process to their original positions and to clean the console with the provided cloth as part of the complete process.",

    "[op_141]",
    "While watching Bella's analysis, Gideon's thoughts turned in a different direction.He would leave the identification of the bug to Bella. The problem was how to apply a patch to their own world.The Mother Computer, with its authority to freely move through timelines, must have privileged access to this simulation world.Executing a fix program created by Bella via the Mother Computer to directly rewrite the laws of the world seemed like the most reliable method. But there, Gideon's thoughts hit a snag.From the \"Nation Game\" documents, they had determined the current year was 2206.But there was no clue anywhere as to whether the technology to access the transcendent entity known as the Mother Computer existed in this era.",
    "[op_125]",
    "Cora's attention drifted from the discussion to a logo on one of the scattered documents.It was for an operating system called \"N-OS,\" but the design was familiar to her.It was identical to the logo she had seen every time she operated a control terminal in the \"Mother Mother Company's warehouse,\" the facility founded by Papacola, isolated from the outside world.She didn't know why, but fragments of her memories from her time in the facility began to resurface.",
    "[op_57]",
    "For Cora, life in the facility had been a monotonous routine.Cora and the dozens of \"substitutes\" who shared her face.Their main job was to take turns being brain-scanned, but their free time was relatively unrestricted.The facility had a huge library, but it was filled only with technical books and academic papers; there wasn't a single work of fiction or entertainment.One day, Cora did something different from the other substitutes. She noticed that one of the library terminals would occasionally produce an external network connection error.The error logs contained fragmented descriptions of an \"N-OS\" debug mode not visible in normal operation.Over years, Cora pieced together these fragments and discovered the existence of a hidden function deep within the system.It was a function that allowed for limited rewriting of the operational sequences of the automatons that produced the facility's supplies.Using this, she tried to generate a food called \"cake,\" for which only a recipe data remained, instead of the usual tasteless nutrient paste.However, what was produced was a gray, geometric lump that bore no resemblance to a cake.When she put it in her mouth, it crumbled like tasteless sand.The memory of that failure now came back to her vividly.The N-OS logo was, for Cora, a bitter symbol of her challenge against the laws of the world, and her defeat.She desperately searched the abyss of her memory, trying to recall something more important, something hidden behind that failure.",
    "[op_137]",
    "The memory of failing to create a cake and producing a tasteless, sand-like lump was not enough to dull Cora's spirit of inquiry.Rather, the complete failure prompted her to turn her attention to other possibilities.The facility's library archived not only data on material composition but also vast amounts of text on acoustics and music theory.Reproducing taste, a complex chemical reaction, might have been beyond the capabilities of the facility's automatons.But sound was just vibrations in the air, physical waveform data.Compared to creating matter from scratch, controlling the frequency of energy already flowing through the existing equipment seemed far more feasible.",
    "[op_136]",
    "Cora once again accessed the debug console hidden deep within N-OS.She focused on the large-scale air circulation system that ran 24/7 to maintain the facility's environment.The operating noise of the giant fans that circulated air through countless ducts was a constant, low-frequency hum that usually went unnoticed.Cora thought that by subtly and periodically changing the rotational speed of these fans, she could control the vibration of the air flowing through the ducts—in other words, the pitch.From the library, she found the sheet music data for an ancient nursery rhyme with the simplest structure and spent several weeks building a program to convert its musical scale information into a sequence to control the fans' rotation.",
    "[op_138]",
    "On the day of execution, Cora waited in the facility's central living area.At the designated time, the facility fell silent. The air circulation system had completely stopped.The next moment, as Cora held her breath, the system restarted, and a sound echoed throughout the facility.But it was not the simple, gentle nursery rhyme melody she had hoped for.The first few notes barely managed to follow the sheet music, but the melody soon began to collapse.The pitch fluctuated unstable, creating a jarring dissonance, as if a giant, out-of-tune stringed instrument were being strummed with brute force.The rhythm broke, stretched, and was mixed with non-existent noise, filling the entire space with an eerie cacophony.It sounded less like music and more like the tormented cry of a lifeless machine questioning its own existence.",
    "[op_139]",
    "The strange sound reached the ears of the few remaining substitutes who were performing their routines in various parts of the facility.As if on command, they all stopped what they were doing at the exact same moment.One was about to bring a paste of nutrient food to their mouth, another was just about to put on a headset for a brainwave scan—their movements completely frozen.They didn't look for the source of the sound, but simply stared at a single point in the void.On their unchanging, expressionless faces, a faint, almost data-error-like hint of confusion appeared.Eventually, the performance ended, and the air circulation system returned to its normal operating hum.The substitutes, too, resumed their interrupted actions as if nothing had happened.The facility returned to a complete, uncreative silence.",
    "[op_57]",
    "The two failures engraved a single, clear understanding in Cora's mind.The facility known as \"Mother Mother Company's warehouse,\" and the N-OS system at its core, were not suited for \"creating\" new things.It was a completely closed system, designed only to \"reproduce\" given information according to a given procedure, without the slightest deviation.She remembered the sense of incongruity that occurred when trying to process unexpected information, whether given from outside this closed world or generated from within.That systemic rejection, her intuition told her, might be the true nature of the phenomenon they were now calling a \"bug.\"",
    "[op_143]",
    "Cora slowly stood up. Noticing her movement, Bella and Gideon stopped typing and looked at her.Cora walked to the conference room whiteboard and wrote a single word in the center: \"Sushi.\"From there, she drew several lines, and at the end of each, she placed words she had dredged up from her past.\"Taste,\" \"Aroma,\" \"Texture,\" \"Technique,\" \"Aesthetics,\" \"Emotion.\"Finally, she added the words \"Creative Failure\" and circled them.",
    "[op_142]",
    "The moment they saw the diagram, Bella and Gideon felt the fragmented pieces of information from their respective investigations converging into a single answer.Bella understood that the young designer's inexplicable operations were a pinpoint attack on the system's greatest vulnerability: \"sensory creation.\"Gideon realized that the act of perfectly recreating a single dish, \"sushi,\" was the ultimate \"creative\" demand, one that would fundamentally destroy the system's design philosophy of \"reproduction.\"There were no words between them. The bug wasn't a piece of malicious code.It was an exquisitely crafted logical trap, exploiting the system's fundamental limitations.Before them, in the silent conference room, only the design documents on the monitor continued to emit a faint glow.",
    "Just then, Gideon received a telepathic message from the stain.It was a message from the stain, relaying a message from Katelyn.",
    "[op_0]",
    "The person Katelyn had asked the stain to contact on the bench was Gideon.After spending hours playing Modified Rock-Paper-Scissors with Laila, the next person who had made a strong impression on her was Gideon, who had shared the information about the extinction with the crew.Her hope that he might be alive somewhere in this world was answered almost as soon as it was formed.The stain telepathically informed her, with surprising speed, that it had made contact with Gideon.",
    "[op_132]",
    "According to Gideon's information, they were in the year 2206, and it was highly likely that the world's bug was the \"recreation of sushi.\"He also relayed the hypothesis that this world itself might be a simulation.Katelyn was first stunned by the enormous time gap between her own time, 2034, and theirs.However, the hypothesis that the world might be a simulation, connected to her own experience of the \"reveal,\" was something she could accept with surprising ease.Next, Katelyn entrusted a question to the stain.She asked Gideon why the Mother Computer had answered with \"sushi,\" the very trigger of the bug, as the means to save humanity.",
    "[op_144]",
    "Katelyn could sense the three of them discussing on the other side of the telepathic link.Gideon suggested the possibility that it was a trap set by the Mother Computer.Cora countered, based on her experience and intuition, that the Mother Computer would never engage in such deceit.Gideon argued logically that sushi had to be one or the other—either the \"bug that destroys the world\" or \"something that saves it,\" but it couldn't be both.Finally, Bella proposed the safest course of action: to freeze all activities related to \"sushi\" at present and completely eliminate the risk of extinction.",
    "[op_133]",
    "Listening to their debate, Katelyn looked down at the bench in front of her.As she mulled things over, the light accompanying her changed its blinking rhythm, and letters slowly began to form on the wooden backrest of the bench.The content was a guideline that addressed the question Katelyn had and the problems the three had raised.Katelyn relayed the idea presented by the light, almost as if it were her own, to Gideon and the others through the stain.",
    "[op_134]",
    "The proposal was that it was impossible to determine at present whether \"sushi\" was a bug or not, and that they should wait and see, observing the actions of the simulation world's designers, especially until the release of \"Nation Game.\"The eras Katelyn and the others were in, if they were part of a simulation, were already fixed events. To change the future, they should first focus on carefully observing the causal events and gathering information.Gideon, Bella, and Cora agreed with the rational proposal.",
    "[op_0]",
    "And so, about two months passed.In the year 2206, in a hotel room near the offices of Simulation World Design, Inc., Gideon, Bella, and Cora were holding their breath, staring at a single monitor.Through the keylogger Bella had planted, they were monitoring the screen of the glasses-wearing designer's computer in real time.On the screen, a vast amount of code was displayed, showing him secretly incorporating some kind of countermeasure to the \"sushi\" bug into the system.It was a patch born of anguish, one that turned the fatal bug planted by the young designer against itself, leaving a limited possibility of salvation for the future.At the same time, in the year 2034, Katelyn, who had found temporary lodging in an internet cafe near a station, was also quietly watching this historic moment through the regular reports sent via the stain.",

    "In the year 400,000,005 AD, the spaceship Poraporaporapora, carrying Allen, Baker, Clark, Dunn, Evans, Ford, Green, Harris, Ingram, James, Kelly, Lee, Miller, Nelson, Oliver, Parker, Quinn, Robinson, Smith, Thomas, Upe, Balsamicos, White, Xavier, Young, and Zimmerman, was on its return voyage to Earth.The Poraporaporapora was the third vessel of the \"Spaceship Poraporapora Existence Awareness Fleet,\" a fleet created to broadcast the Poraporapora's existence across the universe.The mission was scheduled to last 400 days—a very long journey away from Earth for over a year—but its end was finally just around the corner.",
    "The greatest challenge for the crew during the long voyage was the rotating \"Manned Surveillance Shifts.\"Most of that time was spent re-examining data generated by machines, making mental fortitude a crucial key to surviving the long journey through space.To suppress mental turmoil, the crew of the Poraporaporapora needed one thing above all else: entertainment.And the thing that sustained them, even at the very end of their journey, was \"revolving sushi.\"",

    "The spaceship Poraporaporapora was, as its name suggests, planned to commemorate the achievements of the original spaceship Poraporapora.Those achievements refer to the series of events in which the crew of the old Poraporapora confronted the fundamental bug that the world was facing at the time, namely, the collapse of the simulation world.",
    "In the process of unraveling the mystery of \"sushi,\" which held the potential to rewrite the laws of the world itself, they succeeded in creating a new concept of sushi.It was called \"Probabilistic Problem-Solving Sushi,\" and it had the causality-defying property of randomly solving one problem somewhere in the world the moment it was eaten.The crew carried out the seemingly reckless strategy of continuously eating this sushi.As a result, from among the countless problems existing in the world, the event of the fundamental bug itself that was causing the simulation world to collapse being \"solved\" occurred miraculously.By this unexpected, yet all-too-convenient conclusion, the world was saved.",
    "To pass on this historic achievement to future generations, and to honor their courage and miraculous luck, another \"pola\" was added to the name of the new ship. The fact that \"revolving sushi\" was established as entertainment on board was also a remnant of that.",
    "[op_145]",
    "This \"revolving sushi\" session took place during the 893rd Manned Surveillance Shift, and the participants were Robinson, Xavier, Kelly, and Miller.The four of them surrounded the quietly flowing conveyor belt.Every time a plate with strange sushi like tomatoes or cake passed by, they would occasionally reach out and enjoy its taste.The ancient cuisine that was said to have once saved the world had now become a gentle pastime to relieve the boredom of a long space journey, and only a quiet time flowed around the four of them.",
