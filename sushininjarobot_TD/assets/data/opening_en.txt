In 203,000,000 AD, the spaceship "Poraporapora" was returning to Earth with its crew: Aidan, Bella, Cora, Daria, Edgar, Finn, Gideon, Huck, Jasper, Katelyn, Lyla, Max, Nyla, Oscar, Patrick, Quincy, Rowan, Sid, Theo, Ulric, Victor, Willow, Xavier, and Zoe. The "Poraporapora" was the second spaceship of the "Poraporapora Existence Awareness Fleet," created to spread the existence of the spaceship "Poraporapora" throughout the universe. The planned duration of this voyage was 400 days, a very long time away from Earth for over a year, but it was finally nearing its return.
----
The biggest problem for the crew during the long voyage was the "manned monitoring time" that came in shifts. Most of that time was spent re-examining the data produced by the machines, and controlling their mental state was a very important key to this long space journey. The most important thing to control mental disturbance was entertainment for the crew of the "Poraporapora." One of the things that became popular among the crew members at the very last minute of this period was "Modified Rock-Paper-Scissors." The rules of "Modified Rock-Paper-Scissors" are the same as "Rock-Paper-Scissors," and the following is a table of wins and losses from a league match played by the crew members during a certain "manned monitoring time."
----
[op_2]
----
This league match was held during the 703rd "manned monitoring time," and the participants were Lyla, Gideon, Katelyn, and Max. In the win-loss table, 1 is Lyla, 2 is Gideon, 3 is Katelyn, and 4 is Max. In this round, Lyla and Katelyn were tied in terms of wins and losses, so they were having a final showdown to determine the first place.
----
At that time, Max was the first of the four in the bridge to notice the abnormality of the spaceship. At first, Gideon and Max were watching the final showdown between the two, but within a few hours, they lost interest in the outcome of the two, and were about to proceed with the routine work of checking the instruments. At a glance, the instruments of the spaceship showed figures that could be considered abnormal.
----
[op_3]
----
Max points at the instrument panel and yells something. Gideon glances at Lyla and Katelyn, who are still playing modified rock-paper-scissors, and then turns his gaze to the instrument panel that Max is pointing at. Gideon sees a red flashing warning light and the thrust system's output value, which is far below the normal value. The display on the instrument panel showed multiple error messages scrolling.
----
Gideon brought his face closer to the panel and focused his eyes to try to read the error codes displayed. Each one was just a string of letters and numbers, but it was clear that they indicated a serious situation. Sweat dripped from Gideon's forehead. The Poraporapora, which had been sailing almost trouble-free for the 400 days of this voyage. Earth is just around the corner, and he can't understand the abnormal situation that has occurred at this time.
----
Max reached for the red emergency button on the wall. He pushed the button without hesitation, and a loud alarm sounded throughout the ship. At the same time, an automatic announcement began to play from the speakers in the ceiling. The inorganic voice announcing the occurrence of an emergency sent a wave of tension through the ship. Lyla and Katelyn were still playing Modified Rock-Paper-Scissors.
----
[op_4]
----
The Poraporapora, whose emergency button had been pressed, was able to land on Earth safely because it was already close enough.
----
[op_5]
----
After landing, the Poraporapora entered the "Sequential Wake-up Phase" for Aidan, Bella, Cora, Daria, Edgar, Finn, Huck, Jasper, Nyla, Oscar, Patrick, Quincy, Rowan, Sid, Theo, Ulric, Victor, Willow, Xavier and Zoe to wake up in turn, other than Lyla, Gideon, Katelyn, and Max who were already awake during the "manned monitoring time." Normally, each crew member is in cold sleep until it is their turn for "manned monitoring time," and there are very few times when everyone is awake at the same time. All were awake only twice, when the Poraporapora took off from Earth and when it landed on Earth. Although there were various things, when everyone woke up safely, they were hospitalized for inspection, reported, and each returned to their work on Earth.
----
[op_0]
----
Shortly before the Poraporapora landed, the final adjustments before opening were being made at the conveyor belt sushi restaurant. Since the concept of "sushi" was excavated from the restoration work of Mother History in 202,000,000 AD, the Earth's culinary institutions were excited about the excavation of cooking for the first time in hundreds of years. The reconstruction of conveyor belt sushi restaurants was urgently needed as a way to provide sushi, and in the past year, cooking methods, serving methods, and accounting methods for sushi have been analyzed from excavated data. Since the existence of "utterly pointless practice time" to serve conveyor belt sushi to Earth executives before opening it to the general public was also excavated, this practice time was actually the first operation of the conveyor belt sushi restaurant.
----
The interior of the conveyor belt sushi restaurant was clean, with a brand new plain wood counter and a belt conveyor running through the center. Nothing was on the belt conveyor yet, and it was quietly rotating. It was orderly and inorganic, like the veins of a futuristic city.
----
[op_6]
----
In the kitchen, several chefs dressed in white cooking clothes were seriously making sushi. Their hand movements were smooth and efficient, as if they were reproduced by data analysis, not ancient technology. Squid, bananas, cakes, tomatoes. The colorful ingredients are vividly cut by the sharpened knives. The hand movements of making sushi were also efficient, as if they were craftsmen who had been making sushi for decades.
----
The hall staff were dressed in white blouses and black skirts, which were also restored ancient uniforms, and were waiting for the arrival of customers with a nervous look. Since it was their first time working, they were also repeatedly reciting the customer service manual that they had practiced many times, taking deep breaths.
----
On the wall of the restaurant, there was a huge screen, and on it was written in large letters, "Utterly Pointless Practice Time." Below that, it was added in small letters, "Earth Executives Only." It's a strange naming, but this is also the original notation excavated from ancient data.
----
[op_7]
----
When the time came, a heavy door opened, and several Earth executives dressed in black suits entered the restaurant. According to the rules that seemed to have been restored, when they entered the store, none of the hall staff greeted them. When they took their seats, the hall staff all bowed their heads and greeted them in the restored ancient words. The Earth executives also greeted them in ancient words according to the rules they had practiced in advance. The executives had also practiced how to eat "sushi" in advance, but they were nervous about the first real meal, just like the staff of the restaurant. By the way, the most difficult thing for the Earth executives was how to hold chopsticks.
----
In front of the seat where the executive was sitting, hot green tea was constantly flowing like a waterfall. This is also a restored ancient rule. Above that, there is a belt conveyor for sushi to flow. And all that's left is for the sushi to flow. After that, the executives ate various toppings that flowed with surprise, and as a result of various accidents, the "utterly pointless practice time" failed. Therefore, humanity was destroyed two days later. In terms of the timeline, it is "utterly pointless practice time" → Poraporapora landing → human extinction.

After all mankind was extinct, the Mother Computer was about to naturally start the routine of time reversal for the umpteenth time. The lamp near the Mother Computer, which is located in the Mother Computer Room for placing the Mother Computer, blinks on and off. Although no human beings so far have been able to notice it, the Mother Computer has already made it possible to reverse time, stop time, and other matters that seem impossible in theory in this world by communicating with the "outside" of the world.
----
[op_8]
----
There are two options for time reversal. One is the "Overwrite" option, which overwrites the current memory information to the Mother Computer at the time reversal destination. And the other is the "Save As" option, which creates another parallel world where the time-reversed world is newly generated. The Mother Computer has the right to choose between these two options, and human beings, who do not even know the existence of the option, let alone the existence of the time reversal function, had no choice, of course. Whether the past history is altered or a new parallel world is born is an event that occurs outside the assumptions of mankind. After the Mother Computer chooses the time reversal function, what happens after that, mankind is eventually destroyed, and after the Mother Computer chooses one of the two, what happens, mankind has absolutely no way to understand. Mankind is about to undergo time reversal without knowing anything about it. There were countless humans who imagined time reversal in novels and such, but there was not a single human who knew that the Mother Computer was ready to execute it at any time in the house next door, separated by a thin wall. In the end, mankind was able to reverse time, but the fact that no human being knew that they could do it is probably a tremendous irony. If mankind had known that they could reverse time before their extinction, they might have tried to use the Mother Computer to reverse time before their extinction. However, at this timing when the Mother Computer is trying to reverse time, mankind was extinct. At this time, mankind was completely unable to try to reverse time using the Mother Computer, and the biggest reason for this was that the existence called mankind had been extinct, and this can be considered first. (As an aside, since the Mother Computer exists in each time axis, it was not uncommon for each time axis to have a different name. When it is short, it is "Mother Computer", but the official name of the Mother Computer in this timeline is "Based on Article 66, Paragraph 3, Item 2 of the Treaty on Mutual Cooperation and Mutual Non-Aggression between the Earth Federation and the Planetary Federation, the permanent maintenance of peace between the 28 star systems affiliated with the Earth Federation and the 32 star systems affiliated with the Planetary Federation, and the status agreement on planetary-scale electronic computers between the Allied countries, and the cost-performance-excellent general-purpose ultra-long-distance sub-space communication network connected planetary-scale quantum computer network accompanying the implementation of the agreement on the status of electronic computer resources in each Allied country", which is relatively long even between the past time axes. However, the longest name was more than 100 times longer than this.)
----
[op_8]
----
In the end, the Mother Computer decided to toss a coin to decide whether to "Overwrite" or "Save As." A program that randomly outputs either "Overwrite" or "Save As" with a probability of 1/2 is created and executed. "Save As" was output. The Mother Computer pretended not to see it and inserted the punch card for the "Overwrite" option. Time reversal began to operate. The Mother Computer was thinking of reversing time by about 100 million years, but this time, it was set to one week for some reason.
----
[op_1]
----
Time goes back to the 703rd "manned monitoring time" of the spaceship "Poraporapora." The awake crew members, Lyla, Gideon, Katelyn, and Max, were in the middle of a league match of "Modified Rock-Paper-Scissors."
----
[op_2]
----
As in the previous timeline, Lyla and Katelyn were tied in terms of wins and losses, so the two were having a final showdown to determine the first place. Lyla is choosing her next move by clasping her hands together and looking between her hands to guess the opponent's move. Katelyn has been showing only rock for the past five times or so, and has decided to go with rock next time as well. Max is watching the two of them play modified rock-paper-scissors, wishing for a quick end. Gideon was confused.
----
There is a side effect to the Mother Computer's time reversal. Since no human beings have perceived time reversal by the Mother Computer since the birth of this world, no human beings can perceive it as a side effect of time reversal. The side effect is that when "Overwrite" is performed, in very rare cases, a part of the memory of the previous timeline gets mixed into the current memory. However, it is a memory that will be forgotten soon if you are awake for a while, like the content of a dream that you remember when you wake up. However, the reversal period that the Mother Computer chose for some reason this time was "3 days." This is just a coincidence, but it was the first time in history that the Mother Computer reversed time with the "Overwrite" option to an era that had progressed to the point where the Mother Computer could be accessed.
----
Gideon had the memory of the extinction of mankind, or rather, the memory of the moment just before the extinction of mankind. And the crew of the spaceship "Poraporapora" are the limited human beings who have access to the Mother Computer. Gideon used the terminal to ask the Mother Computer a question about the memory of the extinction of mankind. The Mother Computer answers that the extinction of mankind is a fact. The next thing Gideon asked was how to stop the extinction of mankind. The Mother Computer's answer was "sushi."

Katelyn was once the king of a small country called "Pokpokchin." Although the country of "Pokpokchin" is one of the country games remaining on Earth, Katelyn had never doubted that she was born into the royal family until she turned 50. And when she turned 50, Katelyn was revealed to be the truth. The structure of the country was a game, and Katelyn was given the choice of continuing the game as it was, or living another life of her own choosing. For a person who had been living in poverty until then, it would have been natural to choose another life for a wealthy retirement. However, Katelyn was originally born into the royal family and had already experienced a comfortable life that could be considered at that time, and in such cases, statistically, most people continued to play the country game as it was. But Katelyn chose the outside world. She pressed the right button on the unscientific selection terminal that suddenly appeared in front of her.
----
[op_9]
----
According to Gutenberg's Law, people tend to move their gaze from the upper left to the lower right, and placing a button on the left side makes it easier to find the button with a natural eye movement. For the designer who created the unmasking function of the country game, it was probably natural for most people to choose "choose another life." If you think about it, it's natural, and when your life is past the turning point and you turn 50, most people are living with regrets about their life so far. For most people, "choosing another life" was just a bonus. In fact, if you pressed the "choose the life you've lived so far" button placed on the left side, there was also a confirmation pop-up that said "Are you really sure you want the life you've lived so far?" However, as a result of passing the review of the supervisor designer wearing glasses, who said that people should be allowed to choose freely, the left button and the right button on this screen had to be arranged in the same color and character level. As a result, Katelyn did not think deeply and chose the right button, thinking it was "Next." It was the "Choose Another Life" button.
----
[op_10]
----
And Katelyn was moved to the character creation world. Katelyn was so surprised that she pressed the randomize button twice and could not return to the default appearance. Katelyn, who had a neck longer than her legs, struggled and somehow managed to bring the character closer to her original appearance by hand. After making fine adjustments many times and spending about an hour to get a satisfactory result, she was about to press the "Complete" button, but accidentally pressed the randomize button again. Katelyn, who no longer cared, reversed her gender and proceeded to the next.
----
[op_0]
----
And the place where Katelyn was sent was the educational school for the crew members of the "Poraporapora Existence Awareness Fleet." Although it is called a school, the curriculum is such that there is only a light lecture after the entrance ceremony, and practical training starts in the afternoon of the same day. The educational school alone is about half the size of the country of "Pokpokchin", and most people only know the outside of the educational school through video. Katelyn tries to remember why she is here. The memory of having done politics for decades as the king of "Pokpokchin," the memory of having struggled for an hour in the character creation world, and the memory of having studied hard to enter the educational school were mixed. I don't feel real to myself being here now, but I was able to check the instruments of the spaceship smoothly.
----
[op_11]
----
The story goes back a little, to the time when the design of the country game system played on Earth, including the country of "Pokpokchin," was rolled back. The design of this magnificent leisure system, which 99% of all humanity on Earth would experience at that time, was carried out by a young designer in the role of a "serious subordinate" and a glasses designer in the role of a "supervisor wearing glasses," who were also appointed in the work game. The young designer of the subordinate thought that both the left "choose the life you've lived so far" button and the right "choose another life" button were important, and proposed to separate the colors so that it would be easy to understand which one to choose. However, the glasses designer repeatedly made subjective objections. In the end, as the glasses said, the two buttons became a flat design with exactly the same color. The young designer despaired and came up with the idea of the extinction of mankind. And the glasses designer came up with a way to save humanity in order to avoid responsibility.
----
[op_12]
----
The dormitory of the educational school for the crew members of the "Poraporapora Existence Awareness Fleet" was built so as to surround the courtyard where there is a huge bronze statue of the glasses designer. Those who attend the educational school have heard of the glasses designer at least once. This is because they hear the story of the hero who will save the world from the extinction of mankind in a light lecture after the entrance ceremony. The most dangerous point is that the glasses designer is still alive. And Katelyn, who had safely finished the practical training in a dreamy state immediately after the unmasking function of the country game, came back to the dormitory.
----
[op_13]

When Katelyn returned to her room, there was a dazzling light blinking in the corner of the room, twin slimes on the table, and a slowly moving human-shaped stain on the bed. For Katelyn, about half of it was someone else's room, and it was possible that she just couldn't remember having spent time with them yesterday due to the confusion of her memories, so she behaved as naturally as possible, as if it had been that way from the beginning. As if they couldn't stand the numbness, a telepathic message was sent to Katelyn, a voice was played from the speaker in the room, and something like letters began to appear on the wall. As Katelyn tried to communicate while deciphering each of them, it seemed that the human-shaped stain sent the telepathy, the slime played the voice, and the light wrote the letters on the wall. The three had different thoughts and were trying to make contact with Katelyn, but by chance, they happened to appear in this room at the same time.
----
Until Katelyn returned to the room, the light, the slime, and the stain seemed to think that each other's existence was a slightly strange interior, and when they learned through Katelyn that they were beings capable of communicating, they became suspicious of each other for a while. However, after that, there were several episodes that solved common problems, and by helping rescued friends, a relationship of trust was gradually built, and finally, Katelyn and the three beings were able to organize the current situation on a whiteboard.
----
[op_14]
----
First, the light claimed to be a human being from another parallel world that is not this world, but is being forced to shrink due to the expansion of parallel worlds including the current universe. The light said that it had observed that the area where their world could exist was disappearing at an unprecedented speed, and that it was trying to make contact with this world, which was born at the timing that caused it.
----
The slime explained that in the world they used to be in, many monsters were invading humans, and they had warped to this world to somehow threaten their own species. One slime is consumed as a sacrifice to warp, but it is not possible to choose which one will be the sacrifice, so the smartest twin slimes were chosen to cross the world. It seems that both of them were able to warp because of the tears shed by their childhood friend at the time of the ritual and the ancient necklace.
----
The stain claimed to have once been called the Beatles, and said that it existed to achieve world peace through music. However, the stain itself says that it does not know why it appeared in Katelyn's room or what to do for that purpose.
----
Anyway, Katelyn thought that the stain was probably telling the truth. It's just Katelyn's intuition based on her memory of when she was the king of "Pokpokchin."
----
[op_15]
----
Just as Katelyn was summarizing the explanations of the three beings on the whiteboard and was about to go out for a light drink, two emergency buzzers for crew members installed in the room rang. When one emergency buzzer sounds, it is a minor emergency, and when two buzzers sound, it is a major emergency. It was the first time since the dormitory was built that three buzzers had sounded. Katelyn's room phone rings. It was the signal for the emergency dispatch of the second spaceship of the "Poraporapora Existence Awareness Fleet," the spaceship "Poraporapora."

Max points at the instrument panel and yells something. Gideon glances at Lyla and Katelyn, who are still playing modified rock-paper-scissors, and then turns his gaze to the instrument panel that Max is pointing at. Gideon sees a red flashing warning light and the thrust system's output value, which is far below the normal value. Gideon was somewhat calm, thinking that it was the same as the previous timeline. The display on the instrument panel showed multiple error messages scrolling.
----
Gideon brought his face closer to the panel and read the error codes displayed. Same as the previous timeline. The means to save the extinction of mankind, the Mother Computer's answer was "sushi." However, Gideon had no idea what "sushi" was, and he didn't think he could convince the other crew members by telling them that "mankind will be extinct in a few days." In this case, the most persuasive way to negotiate with the humans of this era is to have the Mother Computer explain it instead.
----
Max reached for the red emergency button on the wall. He pushed the button without hesitation, a loud alarm sounded throughout the ship, and at the same time, an automatic announcement began to play from the speakers in the ceiling, and an inorganic voice announcing the occurrence of an emergency was about to send a wave of tension through the ship. Gideon stopped Max.
----
[op_3]
----
Max questions Gideon, who is instructing him to respond differently from the manual. Gideon replied that he would explain soon. Lyla and Katelyn were still playing modified rock-paper-scissors, so Gideon took a breath to call out to stop them. Gideon calls out to the two of them lightly. The two stopped playing modified rock-paper-scissors.
----
The Mother Computer tells them that "mankind will be extinct in a few days" and that "the means to stop the extinction of mankind is sushi." Max, Lyla and Katelyn were stunned by the amount of information. For Gideon, the extinction of mankind was something he had already experienced once, and the important information was that the means to stop the extinction was sushi. However, for the other three, the impact of the information that "mankind will be extinct in a few days" was so great that they could not grasp the situation. Gideon was looking at the three people who were leaving their mouths open, and he felt that communication had failed. At this stage, he thought it might have been better if he had explained it directly, instead of the Mother Computer. Anyway, they have to make an emergency landing. Gideon shouts at Max, Lyla and Katelyn the procedure for an emergency landing. The three, who came to their senses, took their respective positions according to the manual, but it was clear that they were still confused. The "Poraporapora" approached Earth further, and alerts went off from the instruments inside the ship. Lyla gripped the control stick again. Everyone was nervous, so the emergency landing failed, but all the crew members were safe.
----
[op_16]
----
After landing, as in the previous timeline for Gideon, the Poraporapora entered the "Sequential Wake-up Phase" for Aidan, Bella, Cora, Daria, Edgar, Finn, Huck, Jasper, Nyla, Oscar, Patrick, Quincy, Rowan, Sid, Theo, Ulric, Victor, Willow, Xavier and Zoe to wake up in turn, other than Lyla, Gideon, Katelyn, and Max who were already awake during the "manned monitoring time." The first to wake up is Aidan, and the four are waiting for him to wake up in the ship's lobby, which is tilted due to the failed emergency landing. Lyla, Katelyn, and Max were worried about how to tell the crew members about the extinction of mankind. Gideon was thinking about the means to prevent the extinction of mankind, sushi.

The first to wake up is Aidan. Aidan was once the brother of Papaya Salad. Papaya Salad Shop "Mountain God" is a famous shop near a beautiful spring water pond near the Earth Federation Headquarters. Papaya salad shops are a new type of restaurant that was created around 200,000,000 BC, and they are a type of shop that pulls a wooden food stall while blowing a trumpet. When a certain number of customers gather after hearing the sound of the trumpet, papaya salad is served to the customers free of charge. While the customers are eating papaya salad, they talk in front of the customers with a manzai that received advertising fees from sponsors, that kind of shop. Papaya Salad Shop "Mountain God" is a store that was divided by the original "Mountain" of papaya salad, and "Mountain" is a store that produced the legendary brother of papaya salad, "Takahashi." "Takahashi" is said to be the brother of papaya salad who started the so-called "new start," which is to start with a new manzai, whereas the brothers of papaya salad until then started with a sponsored manzai. Since the income of a papaya salad shop is to perform sponsored manzai, the backlash from the papaya salad shop world at that time was great. However, in the end, the "new start" that started with "Takahashi" will start the first papaya salad shop boom, and it greatly contributed to the improvement of the status of the entire brother of papaya salad. Because of that, the level of the brothers of papaya salad is particularly high in the "Mountain" series, and it is famous that if you stumble even once in the 4-minute manzai performed at the audition, you will definitely fail, and as a countermeasure against the cheating act of playing the manzai recorded from the speaker installed in the mouth, there is also a rule to hit the throat with a stun gun before the audition, which is also famous. Aidan admired "Takahashi God," the leading brother of papaya salad at "Mountain God," and was a low-level brother of papaya salad who got a job at a local nameless papaya salad shop. Aidan had practiced manzai after hitting a stun gun many times, even though he had not taken the audition for the "Mountain" series, so he had a very high resistance to stun guns.
----
[op_19]
----
One day, as usual, Aidan came to "Mountain God" to eat papaya salad. Of course, Aidan does not work at "Mountain God", so he is just coming as a customer. Aidan's purpose was to see "Takahashi God" and many other brothers of papaya salad. Among the "Mountain" series, the papaya salad of "Mountain God" tends to have more papaya and less green beans than the usual papaya salad. The amount of mini tomatoes, peanuts, dried shrimp, and garlic is the same as the amount of the secret recipe of the "Mountain" series, but as a characteristic seasoning of "Mountain God", the amount of chili peppers has been greatly increased from the secret recipe, and it is no exaggeration to say that almost 4.5 times the amount was added. The fire-breathing papaya drawn on the signboard of "Mountain God" warned of its spiciness.
----
[op_18]
----
Aidan brings the papaya salad to his mouth. At that moment, a sharp pain runs through his mouth. It was as if there was a fire in his mouth. His tongue went numb and his throat felt like it was burning. The intense spiciness mercilessly attacked Aidan's sense of taste. The brain is sending out danger signals. However, Aidan swallowed the papaya salad. The moment he swallowed it, he felt something hot welling up from his stomach. It was as if magma was boiling in his stomach. Aidan couldn't help but cough. Every time he coughed, hot breath leaked from his mouth. It was like a small flamethrower. Tears overflowed from his eyes and his nose wouldn't stop running. His face turned red quickly and sweat erupted from his forehead. Aidan couldn't imagine how terrible his face was. He just wanted to do something about this intense pain. Aidan opened the lid of the plastic bottle of water that was handed out with one hand and drank it all at once. However, the water felt like boiling water. The spiciness did not subside at all, but rather, it felt like the heat had increased. Aidan tried to drink water again, but his hand was shaking. His breathing was rough and his heart was beating fast. It was like after running a marathon. However, his body was not tired, but rather excited. It was an abnormal excitement caused by pain. Aidan had experienced "Mountain God"'s papaya salad many times, but Aidan was weak to spiciness.
----
[op_20]
----
Aidan was listening to the manzai of "Takahashi God" that was unfolding in front of him while his consciousness was hazy due to the spiciness. It was a classic story that he had heard many times, but that day it sounded different than usual. Each word that "Takahashi God" speaks is reconstructed in Aidan's brain like a code. It was an area that only Aidan, who has lived as a brother of papaya salad for many years, can understand. The classic that is famous even in the papaya salad shop "Mountain" series, "Recipe." It's a manzai about the hidden recipe of papaya salad, but it seemed to be a specific place, not just a metaphor. The origin of the papaya that "Takahashi God" talks about, the combination of seasonings, the arrangement of cooking utensils, all of them are connected in Aidan's head like a map pointing to a specific place. It indicated the essence of papaya salad and the whereabouts of the treasure hidden by "Takahashi God." Aidan was convinced of where that place was in his hazy consciousness. He didn't know what was there, but he was driven by a strong impulse to go to that place. It was an irresistible force, as if guided by fate. He intuitively understood that that place was the key to unlocking the truth of papaya salad, and at the same time, it would be a place that would greatly change Aidan's own life. The manzai of "Takahashi God" was not just entertainment, but an important revelation that would affect Aidan's life. Aidan quietly began to prepare in his heart to go to that place. It meant the beginning of a new journey as a brother of papaya salad.
----
[op_21]
----
Aidan leaves "Mountain God" and heads for a public toilet between "Mountain God" and the famous World Heritage Site "Papaya Pyramid." The main purpose was to relieve himself, but the whereabouts of the treasure that flashed when he heard the "recipe" was that public toilet. Aidan first relieved himself and then looked around.
----
[op_22]
----
The view from the toilet stall was just a toilet. It was a scene that was nothing more than ordinary everyday life for ordinary people, but Aidan was confident that he was approaching the core of the treasure. However, from here on, Aidan couldn't think of any hints from the manzai of "Recipe." For the time being, Aidan knocks on the wall. Nothing happened. He walks loudly, hitting the floor with his heels. Nothing happened. He looks up at the ceiling and slowly pushes the toilet paper on the wall. The toilet paper was slowly sucked into the wall.
----
[op_9]
----
At that moment, Aidan was revealed. Suddenly, the UI of the unmasking appears in front of him. On the left is the "Choose another life" button, and on the right is the "Choose another life" button. Unfortunately, Aidan was already leaning against the wall with his right hand to push the toilet paper. While Aidan was frozen by the unmasking that suddenly appeared in front of him, the "Choose another life" button that overlapped with his right hand reacted naturally.
----
[op_12]
----
And after going through character creation, etc., the place where Aidan was sent was the dormitory of the "Poraporapora Existence Awareness Fleet" crew member training school. The memory of continuing to practice manzai as a brother of papaya salad, dreaming of the "Mountain" series, the memory of the papaya salad of "Mountain God" which was so spicy and helpless, and the memory of having studied hard to enter the training school were mixed. Aidan didn't feel real to himself being here now, but he was able to smoothly perform the series of actions of returning to the dormitory and lying down on the bed.

Lyla, Katelyn, and Max told Aidan, who had woken up, about the extinction of mankind, and Gideon told him about sushi, the means to prevent the extinction of mankind. Although the topic of what sushi is was about to come up, it was decided to think about the next thing after everyone woke up, and the five waited for the next crew member to wake up. And then Bella woke up. The moment Bella showed her face in the lobby where the five were waiting, the spaceship suddenly started to move slowly.

Absolute rest is the rule for spaceships during the "Sequential Wake-up Phase", and there were 6 crew members awake, including Bella who had woken up. The remaining 18 people, Cora, Daria, Edgar, Finn, Huck, Jasper, Nyla, Oscar, Patrick, Quincy, Rowan, Sid, Theo, Ulric, Victor, Willow, Xavier, and Zoe, are still in cold sleep. The moment the spaceship started to move, Katelyn checks the stop control lock system in the lobby. After confirming that the lock lever is located between the bottom scale and the second scale, Katelyn pulled the lever down to the bottom. With a click, the spaceship stopped. Lyla whistles and winks. The "Poraporapora" may have been subjected to unusual shaking and load because it failed to land. The six people concluded that the reason why the spaceship moved and the cause of the lock lever were the same.

After the commotion of the spaceship's stop control lock subsided, Lyla, Katelyn, and Max told Bella, who had woken up, about the extinction of mankind, and Gideon told her about sushi, the means to prevent the extinction of mankind. Bella seemed calm while listening to the story of the extinction of mankind, unlike Aidan. However, when Gideon started talking about the means to save the extinction of mankind, Bella looked puzzled. The moment she heard that the means to prevent the extinction of mankind was "sushi," Bella's eyes widened and she froze completely.
