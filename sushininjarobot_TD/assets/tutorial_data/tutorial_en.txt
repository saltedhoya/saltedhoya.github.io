Card Activation Phase: Cards in your hand automatically activate, enhancing your stats.

----
There are two types of attack methods: "Weapons" and "Towers."
The stats that affect each are different, and there are also "Weapon-only" and "Tower-only" stats.
Please note that increasing stats for a type you don't possess will not have any effect.
----
Also, weapons and towers each have specific targets they can attack, divided into three types.
Stats unrelated to these attack targets will also have no effect, so be sure to check which effects apply to which equipment.

To efficiently defeat sushi, use coins to purchase cards.
Card effects can either have parentheses ( ) or not.
Effects with parentheses ( ) are reset when the round ends, but they are often more powerful as a result.
----
Cards are not purchased by merely selecting them.
Be sure to pull the lever to confirm your purchase.

[t_4]
----
Unless a card has a special notation, its effect will activate during the "Card Activation Phase" at the start of a round, enhancing your stats.
----
There are also various other activation timings, such as "gain effect when a card is purchased," "gain effect every 10 seconds," "gain effect on a critical hit," and "gain effect for specific cards."
----
None of these effects will activate unless the card is active (brightened at the bottom of the screen). Reorder the cards at the bottom of the screen as needed.

{tutorial_key:T_FLYING}
----
[t_5]
----
There are two types of sushi: "ground sushi" that runs on the ground and "flying sushi" that flies in the air.
----
Since each weapon and tower has a specific type of sushi it can attack, make sure to equip yourself to handle both types of sushi.
----
"Ground-only" and "Anti-air only" weapons/towers may have limited use cases, but they often possess powerful effects.

Cards with a "→" notation enhance the effects of other cards.
----
If the type or parameter to be enhanced does not match, the enhancement will not activate.
----
There are also cards that enhance "all parameters," in which case all parameters will be enhanced.
